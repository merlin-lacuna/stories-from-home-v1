I have become a land of the world.

I am no longer one thing, I dissimulate my identity in order to better survive.\n\n

The fauna is still drying up but there are also many new animal species which appear as if out of nowhere – enormous insects whose brittle wings buzz as they walk along wooden planks suspended exclusively beneath their bellies, their hideousness amplified by these primitive structures.

Most animals were devoured by others long ago; only two or three remain alive until this day: a hawk who eats nothing except wood-moth larvae and those female bees who inject mold into soft tree trunks so that they can feed off delicious honey made available to them from inside . . . \n

I have become a land of memory.

It is now impossible for me not to remember myself - even though I continue nevertheless thoroughly transformed here within this moment of "now" with my face turned toward tomorrow ...

My flesh remembers what was possible before hereabouts but did not happen; it remembers all the forms from times past that did not take on form at all because time slumbered undisturbed in its sleepiness. \n\n

I grow dark blue thorns whose sharp tips drink blood so that lightnings may flash!

They strike against full moons!

Crashing thunderbolts ripen grapes large enough for giants to crawl through – and every grape contains several universes!

Vines entwine entire hillsides – homeric vines irrigating whole countries, lifting heavy terrains above\n\n
