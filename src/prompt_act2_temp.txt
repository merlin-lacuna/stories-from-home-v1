I was beautiful for about a week, but I usually am not like this over the winter-months. My snowfall heights remain surprisingly high but are lower than usual here and there despite some temporary warming from a few days of rare sunshine. I also have very fine flakes of ice falling every now and again which occasionally accumulate on my surfaces as smaller snowfalls that turn to slush before finally freezing into sheets once more.\nMy ground has layered it upon itself incrementally over the preceding months until we are knee deep in many places; though here in one scraped spot below me is several feet deep and therefore even harder to navigate through just yet. This melting tarpaulin covers all around us with its fringe brushing our legs, turning them grey where they touch it or brush against it on descent... \nSoon enough down here you look up at a silver stalactite cap barely touching the earth near your head, formed by bits that drip off peak after peak far above... Ice five inches thick fills potholes only last week emptied of larger accumulations entirely...\n\n
