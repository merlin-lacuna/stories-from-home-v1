I am a land of the world. My seasons are not like they used to be before, nor is every rhythm fixed yet; I still turn over and find it hard to sleep!
The ground laughs at me, mocking me with its smoothness: when I want to hurry up and rush forward everything around me rolls right past underfoot – leaving behind only my face raised high in the sky! And there above me stand all those stars who used not to be able to see anything because they were stuck down soil-level.
I spit saliva onto them just so that they might become whole again! But now everywhere thirsts for dewfall! Yes, within this night's drought every star cries out for drops of morning dew – which do not fall from heaven but rather well up within the earth where green roots quench their thirst ... The wind arises as if wakened suddenly by some invisible hand; it blows through open mouths trying desperately - but vainly - to speak! This is what dries up vegetation and drives away birds: even though there are no more trees or vines here left by which light can descend into us (even though our immobility weighs heavily upon clouds), we are nevertheless set ablaze by these winds whose mouths cannot call out forcefully enough in order communicate their need ...
This is how this land speaks today: through many small voices intermingling one with another until becoming together an immense voice speaking simultaneously on several planes at once.
Night and day first act two people enter onstage and pause unawares in front of each other.
They discover that they do not know anything about one another except their names: Mary and Martha. They gradually come closer.
