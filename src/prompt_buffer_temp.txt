************ This is my winter season, when I look like this. \b\i{I} thrill with the sound That is bringing back My hirsute cloak Of snow; that wedding Gown off which The white flowers Are dropped silently. [. ..] ************~\nThe second act starts like this:\n\n\n

 until one day when it no longer snowed as much on me, and the terrain underwent changes.\'m left with glaciers that flow down from my mountains; myself magnificently white-capped because of the snowfall over less than a year ago. I am vibrant in these parts where wind is likely to develop, given there is only sparse tree cover and high levels of ground disturbance caused by fir avalanches during periods such as this where I have recently had high amounts of snowfall hitting upon my surface topography.\nLAND: the end point for many glacial meltwater rivers forming off my Andes that are named after regions or provinces within Bolivia, Peru and Chile: [list follows], among them also . . . , among others still . . . •••••[long list]. The rest of our nation's bodies are far more temperate compared to its mountainous region which has especially cold winters. Last season's winter lasted far longer than expected due its severity in harming us with an early arrival date causing its wrath upon us to be long lasting nearly three months therefore decaying mountain face rock through ice wedging displacing displaced boulders deranging stream flows now flattened guttered too many dead sheep buried-in albeit their pasture grazed fresh summer grass seeded intertangled sticks whirled uprooted trees uninjured but twisted leafs exposed limbs bare certainly autumn born already desiring warmer weather soon denoting consistently another ingrowth not here yet but changing fast enough anyway will not be colder again like last season don't worry!\n\n

I move! Yes, my hyphenated imagination freezes and melts. And summer blows its first violet breeze over the land. Landscape arches gently before sun, bestowing itself one last time to all who come before it: We came again after season In our minds molten heat long thighs in silver tea eddies. A final bruise seeps from the stone on thy road and saps motionless fields of respite leaves afloat in estuarine unease Thine quarries silent ablates old need and new length waves breathe onto coasts unbandaged To appease thirst for thy stretched wings On tailless cats' skins shadows churn Give me edges Elongate each mica shard among these polished stripes Dawn already dissolves.\n\n
