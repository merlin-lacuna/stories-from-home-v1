I am a mute, deranged and wordless land.
The air is heavy, the sea blood-red; I have become a prostitute who prostitutes myself to my own sons.

Land: exhausted/unfertilized/abandoned:
I am dead!
It's useless for you to attempt escape:
There are no more choices left here in this desolation of the soul.
...
What do you think of me?
Do you pity me?
Are you amazed by me?
Well then, know that my heart holds all its strength within itself, right behind your back!
