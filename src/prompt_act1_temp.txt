My summer is cold, my winter warm. I am a country of the future.

So far I have observed that my land is monologizing, but it is also going through an extraordinary metamorphosis from which new forms are flourishing and ebbing – one could even say: giving birth to themselves without ceasing to be what they are.

Herein lies a peculiarity of this performance, I talk about myself within an epochal necessity – passing into another state or "new era" - while I remains as myself, stubbornly refusing to become other than what I have been so far.

My appetite for nature grows bigger with every day; my resistance against foreign elements becomes more tenacious and its immobility constant.

This last character trait seems here especially important: despite all transformations, despite all changes in direction or rhythm occurring within this land's organism, I see how deep down something essential thereto does not change at all : my appearance does indeed alter depending on whether it decides for growth or recession (whether it develops extensive vegetative roots over time or chooses instead earth-covering), but regardless of these fluctuations I note that each time growth wins out over regression there arises nevertheless a rock-like bedrock around which everything else branches outwards . . .

Or still again: when contraction takes place here - forced by scorching temperatures - the plants dry up completely; they push their green leaves into dryness until nothing remains except the yellow skeleton structure filled with air.
