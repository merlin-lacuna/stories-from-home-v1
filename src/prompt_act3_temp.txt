We are here on the edge of what has been called my desiccated zone. Rarely visited I imagine, unless by those few friends we all have who share similar burdens, this is certainly one of the most unstocked parts of myself, and some nearby days’ walk away still hangs the weighted snowfall-limit in crystals that I am greedily beseeching today as I watch them hang towards last winter’s heights despite summer after so hard a spring. I am annoyed but also largely at peace with these demands being made upon me again since it is exhausting to simply butt heads with a foe who so rarely awes you - instead you must ask for great things from them over and over just like lovers do... It will be days yet before any snow falls beyond their current covering anyway, if fallen there is any even left up there given how relentlessly it has melted in recent sunlight (since when did its peak halve such that they drag downwards too much?)
