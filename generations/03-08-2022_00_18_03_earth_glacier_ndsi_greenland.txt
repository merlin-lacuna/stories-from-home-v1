Act 1: Здравствуй, лёд! My ice is vanishing in disproportionate amounts. A mysterious magical veil seems to have crossed over my body. Suddenly I clink and drip incessantly. My surface has cracked into a thousand pieces so that I look akin to floating ice floes that drift out their pathless seaways in frozen oceans or to the dry end of an ice river fed with its glacial meltwater up high. ... One day while roaming around on my moraine I get distanced from myself – crunch!

Act 2: Здравствуй, дым! The mysterious magical veil has thickened to make me smoky and full of creaks. My every stratum takes on a new hewn effect like in an ash-covered landscape that might have witnessed the wrathful fire of the gods. ... One day my moraine is wrenched loose from me – crunch!

Act 3: Здравствуй, излучение! The mysterious magical veil has evaporated to free me entirely into the luminescent blue glow of ultimacy. Up here I have no more groans or creaks: my voice tremblingly escapes entirely and alone as empty radiation – that is what remains when I am gone … One day while meandering along my mineralized moraine edge – crunch! ---- Becoming ice again means donning a silky flowing dress, An iridescent luster flows in all directions, an unspeakable clearness fills everything with meaning and unity. ... ! Naked we enter existence at birth; fragile and unreliable like tiny snows flicked by the cold wind across our short time span on earth – if only we could implore right now for eternity to be saved, alongside one single particle of ice or snowflake already gone beyond its rockiness before it melts away forever!
