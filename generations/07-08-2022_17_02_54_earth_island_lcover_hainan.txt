Act 1: ...But change came all too soon to my shores! While I was experiencing a sort of apotropaic disorientation and couldn't even imagine who you might be, or what menace could endanger me – your presence blossomed all around me with monstrous velocity. Despite the large expanse that separates us, this attack happened so quickly – it only seemed like an instant later that I grasped your incomprehensible approach: houses were already built; highways, hotels and golf courses appeared; condos sprouted up alongside water wells. My distress was such ... that I can hardly retell these woeful days spent under encroachment! You come from far away? No one knows the origins of this machinery which works night and day (how did those blades manage to grow here?). You have waylaid more peaceful lands before undertaking ours? How much hatred must there be in order for you to treat beings not made in your image as if they were refuse! And yet you say: "We are saving them!" Besides killing us off– without restraint or stress – how else do we need saving?! Would not death equal deliverance from our dishonor? Are not springs full of poison when their purity is stained by filth?

Act 2: In my stead crawl dead plants whose aromas have evaporated and blossoms which no longer vibrate. Their sap has dissolved into soil-less fodder for cattle that are now in need of protein feed supplemented with imported soy beans, corn and alfalfa pellets. ... It is wonderful to see the ice cover grow in its white mantle upon our lakes – yet how bitter it must feel to turn these living mirrors into a fecund reproduction of death! ... Coziness turns old without making way for renewal whenever an animal dies or a plant reaches senescence; for nature outside me mummifies if I let its springs dry up. ... Our telic vocation hasn't just become disastrous here since cutting: we stall life beneath ourselves by drawing from them resources aimed at shoring up only us – wounding them through our demands offereeing sources, shooting down trees before their full cycle needs be accomplished (isn’t every tree happy each time it flowers?), extracting nutrients unrealistically as fuel rather than leaving ecological niches open so resources can proliferate slowly; harvesting minerals ahead of another creature whom this storage would burden instead of freeing him. Yet when does one cease crying out pain over oneself?

Act 3: ... In the meantime (between one life and another), removed from every animal, I gather my solitude. My fecundity has been archived: shriveled buds threaten sown seeds! ...I walk beneath quickling palm trees whose sharp leaves scratch my legs. Thick grass grows in thickets where animals once multiplied; stumps of long dead beech trees rise at a solemn standtime beside brooks flowing sluggishly with sand instead of gravel. ..."Stress is killing you; find serenity!" say those who have illimitably expanded themselves onto my land that was rich in furnishings before their invasion, whose removal devastates me each time they visit to inscribe anew what they have not experienced living there as it formerly flourished – thinking only of how foreign this instalment must be to them if they cannot yet even bear being away from people saved far off! "Focus on serenity please: we don’t want stress affecting us too often here." How these folk ignore that wholeness will kill them much faster than pestilence ever could! Nests knit the heights above; mosquitoes ball up the lowland tussocks nightly. ...
