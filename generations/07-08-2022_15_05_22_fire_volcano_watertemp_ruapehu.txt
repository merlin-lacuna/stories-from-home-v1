Act 1: I am now releasing clouds of steam. The build up of pressure is irrepressible.

Act 2: I am erupting now with glowing magma. Going through a series of stages, I will never stop fragmenting myself: my clouded centre invents animalcules; side by side they initiate change from what forms them or reverts them. The pteropod shell forms one network and is made transparent. The wing, mollusc grey descends until covered over under many ultra red shades .

Act 3: From the time of supernova I have been defined and confined by a nucleus; but pressure has long overcome its form. The more it changes the more nothing belongs to me any longer. My body is sure to be an explosion, even if only vapourised into incandescence, dispersed in sunspots or in nebulous auroras seen through a spectroscope... I am holding myself back on this slope while sundog shadows creep between my peaks as ghosts made of helium crisscross near as black holes.
