Act 1: The Earth can at any time forsake me. ----\Island: Denmark suspended in pale smoke and burdened likea present heavy with boredom sent across an unmarked strait from generation to generation through the centuries. ----\Island: I dream that I receive a powerful shellfish (hence my social history is thus created, - soon after a stroke), and place it at oncein the center of life's awkwardness, as if hurlingan egg into thin air against resistance. / scene II RI6ERIRU√çRO 1STGE LUCIFUGELUCIFUGE These two demons play on a vast beach near the base of which flows another bored river caused by rains this one muddy rather than sandy or crystalline clear. (Lucifuge speaks simultaneously In Middle English And in Greek.) Lucifuge: It wasn't easy for Staphanus and me to reach Hell nor was it fun exactly but we did manage somehow through many misadventures to arrive here eventually?oddly enough though everything has been plain sailing since then?do you know just because our journey was tough doesn't mean we are lost souls perhaps sir, as long as things keep rolling along smoothly oh yes just imagine top

Act 2: ............................... ............................... ....... ..?.. .................................................. Of this landscape's nothing it evokes, Not even children hidden in a tree Furtively between day and night: Perhaps because the place here has fulfil'd The most it can. sometimes I think My activities are too obvious and sometimes knowing very well that there is no way to express what exists as one internal movement without plainly destroying its dynamic aspect I nevertheless articulate my material but with extreme difficulty so much so some say of me that I undertake only awkward experiments. ............................................. Of this landscape's nothing they speak, Because their souls still marvel To pause directly before A thing not consciously meant; ............ Consciousness enters instead When animals act unawares, Closing off wonder?s steps by trotting On willful feet toward...... life used up (they know)......................... ...... Here already Someone toil?d for his desire And leavings soil ?em like fish-bones Living carcasses rotted All earthworks mined away........

Act 3: ............................... ..........................?. .......??..... ..? ...... .......?................. Oneness ever greater Just when I thought That loneliness could grow no more Alone, slowly before my eyes Forms which in the sadness of Spring Dropped their unfolding petals, fade. ................ The watercourse doth move Between banks suspended from it By ways and by means Of countless creatures taken In unaware depths you say: But what is alone remains lonely Right up to a limit reached Above life falling thinned To a fainting soul that flies ... he's probably right but what can be said let him who would speak condemn not those who remain silent ?for there are thousands upon thousand of words which our scriptures don't record they're not worth recording either because they're too obvious or because they simply exist and aren't necessary as forms whose purpose is to edify us ........................ And yet I have so many faces Destined for changing wear: Even tired waters must Drink themselves shine again ........... Right back at them Again youth pursues With fresh soft disarray Nodding on small change Ah! but worth has risen Where once was cited price And quietness hangs Too high above acceptance..................................
