ACT 1: How anxious I was to bloom But the mists distorted my views So cut off from vapors and dews, what use is flowering? All turns into stillness and everyone seems at ease until a red glow descends on these tranquil surroundings. Slowly but surely, I will take away all this balm in Gilead ? My beauty has been trampled! Nature's balance cannot support these human excesses? Men have made me dangerous. Oh how careless they are grow faint of heart even before pity feels its stabs... The night is pass‡d; why then art thou thus out alone With importunate frequency ere morning risen? What press‡st thou forward with such strained pace And towards such an awful Pylon turn thy face? Thou also that hast passed thy prime regretting, If only thou couldst be born again: Egyptiac image who once wast held so precious: How many centuries lost thee! 
How abandon us whatever Fate has dictated!?
Turning back no more here you shall stay now; No one owns your beauties any longer. Let your legend not Deform completely In the barbarian memory you receive no Image faithful ever after From those who from a distance gaze.?

ACT 2: Smoke, smoke.Now I'm really thirsty because of your thirst! ... Through my spongy flesh transparent fire travels And then a thousand fires blaze from even the tiniest scratch On every hand welled up abundant as a tree fountain Its fierce heat attacks me hollows out magma Of blood and marrow: inundating roasts me completely Then leaves cold ashes in its wake that are mostly ash? At evening when hides behind her grove the sun you admire Day marches on undaunted only just now scorched Pillaging courtyards where I like to dwell... Smolder cough brings down walls which hardly failed to crumble Interiors darken everywhere there are ruined priceless treasures Standing brackish black swamp ponds hamper passage Encircling white rings around gray icy zones announce.?All falls mercifully silent with black soot laden Preserves what sinks into coal holds breathless In blue aqua; succulent yellow resin recites The gold epaulettes round fragile souls condemned ...

ACT 3: ?Ah! The green tongue of night, so caressingly fresh again On which the grains of sand mingle chime through my clothing What kindness toward you urchins trapped away among steep cliffs Exultant to huddle up in this auroral fleeting shade Urging your sides against there where fire resound? White elms, crowning lovers with bridal bushes Fated soon afterwards by reason's deaf blast ?
