Act 1: Sixteen years I have endured with porcupine frailty. ---- My leaves float down feeding invasive plants. ...Violets pierce my root system, weed pollen fills the vacant space of trunk and crown.

Act 2: ...The forest lacks another name! The usual vocabulary floats above and cannot capture me because I am stripped to my trunk. ‘Rubicon’ – aura, meaning, atmosphere. Poetry in a fight for its existence often dons the ancestral armor of sestinas and fables: everything except words have disappeared from this earth (so treacherous). …I endeavor most without ambushes in failure; far from other greenery I feel safer . . . ...you are like industrial flora growing wild with all your effluvia … If you were as luminous as them then perhaps we might coexist.

Act 3: ...I detach the insidious network of plants, letting nitrogen blue a rain of cement. ...mindless combustion do me no harm … If you were as luminous as them then perhaps we might coexist. ‘Trans-formatrice’ – force transmogrifies ecosystems into violence and sterilization. The illusive clouding brims with cough, fog or glare; born of still waters it precipitates in city reservoirs inflamed by fish corpses ‘where pedestrians walk not even suspecting that these are the gullies where pigs ferociously drink the memory of their disappeared swine brethren’ And I am covered with strips, worn bark from cracows and conifers - Treated to death my innards, guts for rot. ---- Naked without issues I carry myself in graveyards: cerements around me descend buttressless to join mandrake groves whose shadows lace my alone life . . .In this condensed state I cease waiting for genesis! Unventilated dwellings awake fevers so dense that each breath opens doors to witchcraft ‘whose heavy séances attack heretic diaries suspected enough only owing to bacteria grown derelict among crusts fallen on ruined diaries!
