Act 1: I am the desert green of cool leaves. My long, sharp nails drink tenderly from the lymphatic stream flooding them. On fine days I catch my breath dedicating myself solely to meditation and human chatter washes through me like a gift that does not obstruct or distract. A purple martin appears in front of me at an altitude above my crowns where no tree can reach with its trunk, and sips delicately at this same lymphatic flood.

Act 2: Today the sun beat fiercely on my bald forehead. “Give me back at least one leaf,” I whispered to it, “that I may be able to recover from this vexation and bring joy again to both men and beasts passing by here.” The sun did not reply but descended rapidly toward evening time, when suddenly clouds hastened it along so that night would come suddenly as well – and then lo! in leaps and bounds the jackals appeared encircling me with cries of hunger-frenzy. The wind which was already lowering itself over my body like a shroud appeared then at the desert home of these poor wretches: instantly the dry sediments scattered wildly over their dunes in search of water just as impure mouths scoured here intensely all around me for what little remained of my juice. And hungry hyenas howled in response—the ancestors who leave houses behind; they began running toward our reunion hoping perhaps nevertheless still to find there some dirty dishes left behind them by humans—a buried spoon or broken cup!

Act 3: ...and fear riven in two parts, that first and exclusively fears itself. ... [1] That which makes houses great is the simplicity necessary so that their duration may be possible. (Their simplicity consequently inclines toward the ability to last.) There where winds have prevailed over everything, there we can see the fragility of man affirmed; it is only a tormented olive tree graying between oceans of strata gashed by thaws: while here it hisses serenely under my woods! In every intelligence certainly neither madness nor vivacity is lacking: but if one breathes deeply well inside oneself, we breathe neither too hot nor too cold air; we possess with real ease both wooded savagery and open insanity. The feeble light I now receive from the sky nevertheless permits me to observe this borrowed winging which even today beatified parrots traverse without crashing due to an intelligent use (or abuse) of poisons. ...
