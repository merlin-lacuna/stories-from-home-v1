ACT 1: ????Time (s) proceeds by us. ????The climate is tropical and warm, but with some exceptions. ????Growing human population. ????????And then time suddenly halts and a principle of identity encroaches on sites where it shouldn??t?situations where the single-minded way in which we seek our goals impels reality to an imperative condition: the identical.(All around me, aspects are transformed into liquid facts.) This temporal simultaneity has taken away my most extraordinary Moments of trepidation and illumination.


ACT 2: ????Occasional winter and summer. ????Endless energy pursuing what change? ??????????? ????Unnecessary rising sea level. \ n
But the land, with shaking depth, was always a precarious resource in an endless expanse . . . so that there should never be too much happening at once ........A mute freeze nullifies grey desolation and everything is untouched by it .........yesterday after yesterday shifts differently ......Spirals of leaves spread under whatever transpires .. Whenever breath collapses I feel more full ?:

Act 3: The c02 levels in the air above the land are intolerable to humanity as well as fauna.?Everyone flees from this inhospitable place towards other areas inland ("oases") where new lives can persist on life-bearing oxygen. Those people who have means move away but those without suffer just deserts at hands of human scavengers like packs of vultures descending to feast off their helpless numbers.(The social fabric starts to tear open.) Frustration becomes visible but balanced by indifference.

ACT 3: ????Sparsely populated. ????Frequent drought and rain cycle. ????Minimal technological advancement of human and land .......Intense vulnerability brought on by conflicting atmosphere, seasons and nature ................ ...no clear past history ................Public disinterest because civilization is ? still developing ...............Impelled to merge with hostile nature..........Upsurge in immigration..............................Increased c02 rises................................Proximity of Sino-American Bloc...............Swirling migrations.....................Collapsing social networks.......Reduced self perspec?tive............................Daylight scarce....Condensation.........Levels of shrill hardening?????I intuit myself as a background that doesn't have desires so much as obtrusive anxieties?I'm afraid the ground will collapse, leaving me drowned beneath these extremes: ice ages against desert ages; blowing duststorms raging like wild animals; lashings out beset lifeforms with unending states. ????????And death here could be truly putrefactive ??:

ACT 4: The C02 levels are emitting apocalyptic shudders through the entire planet's surface where people persevere without appeal in a stifling sea full of thorns from which they can never emerge safely.
