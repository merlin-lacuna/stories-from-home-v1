ACT 1: My biodiversity is a peaceful biogeogra and there's no reason out. My calcium carbonate, marl and other types of minerals are expensively scattered upon my surface and they never really fuse together except in rare or exceptional situations. I change with the seasons, but always remain myself, whether kind or cruel to those who dwell within me: o silent land where night falls early!

ACT 2: The breeze in the furnace of my still, quiet air moves me. I am full of concealed universes and ripe promises rejoicing among themselves, bringing themselves to fruition. It only feels as if it's autumn but with a hint of nascent summer inside what little summer remains. Nameless appearances irrigate infinite landscapes that scatter out over all directions: o dull land where night falls early!
ACT 3 (final act): Because the rainfall has reached an extremely high level; floods have occurred or are about to occur throughout vast areas rivers overspill their banks and run wild into valleys far from anything supporting them; much of the earth changes style, its delineation forever lost from sight now submerged below swelling pools … If these last two sentences seem incongruous to you, please bear with me for one more instant.

ACT 3: Early sunset brings the passage from autumn to winter. If you look carefully, the ground appears momentarily frozen and cracked. I slumber under an invisible feel ing of distress … My hills enjoy a feeble fertility. Often, out walking my deserted valleys at nightfall along these ancient roads through which no one passes, withering emotions take hold around me like dead leaves in well-worn grooves that no cart has ever gone down … } More kilometers of erratic woodland than exist between me and human dwellings!
ACT 4: A traditional spring revitalizes the land enabling it once more on its slow awakening towards what is essential in life; upward they rise again myriad weeds like those ancient voices never heard before or forgot ten years ago succumbing to unquenched thirst with roots seeking water in that soil once relatively irrigated by divine begettings superior forgotten gods known only to slaves not yet decided into what solitary continuum refracts their disheveled essence?

ACT 1: The air above me is becoming torpid and hot.

ACT 2: In some parts it actually floods, covering cities under a sheet of water. In others fields dissolve into mud and its forests start to fray at their very roots.

ACT 3: Clean, colorful forests litter my furthest reaches. Enormous, painstaking fields of grain and rich crops pinch themselves out spontaneously across the contours of my land mass. The water buffets its way through the riverbanks, chops up into different identities to help create new islands in me.

I arise from all these things as a unified figure which is always changing but never ends up disappearing altogether or becoming something else entirely … Or does it? I don't know what times or seasons are appropriate for this uncertainty that fills me with longing.
AND ES PRESENTES All this occurs twenty-four hours before everything disappears into oblivion … Where will I go? If everyone one day had to leave here forever would they accept that existence? So many disquieting thoughts! And among them you also feel sorry for those who tomorrow must disappear as well And what about today's bread if no hands reach out to bring it nearer? In some sad corner lost in the chaos of losing one's keys full of dreams there resound voices saying: \ A despair without reason draws us still farther downwards towards the black sea lurking deep beneath our uncertain steps.

ACT 1: The air above me feels even more sultry and subtropical. I experience very mild winters and humid, rainy summers. Worldly processes occasionally corrode this corrosion, ending in yet another layer of dust on my eczema.

ACT 2: The air above me is almost entirely sultry and subtropical. Whenever rain falls onto my ulcerous body, I scream with furious rage.

ACT 3: The air above me jocund with joy, bequeaths consoling rains of life onto my bony brow. I experience warm winters and barely-noticeable summers. It is a voluptuous equilibrium that finds its place among the surroundings: earth, water, wind and plants.

The masses are often afraid they might have insufficient spiritual nutrition to survive; thus they seek things wrongly. They dream of leaving their age behind in order utterly to transform it. As if one could escape in time! How much effort must there not be when everything here below has already been spent on analogous worries?

ACT 1: The anfractuosities of my hills mingle with the reflections in my pools, creating perfect mirrors for saddened and deserted expanses … Far from being adequate to form a nation and succeed as such, I nonetheless have become fertile ground for humanity's diverse madnesses: emigration was born here; trade and manufacturing grew here … Severe plagues were easily buried along the foul or stagnant entranceways to this grotesque labyrinth. Here popular uprisings raged endlessly. We opened our clean arms toward impoverished immigrant hordes that robbed us of part of our own genetics while searching out some better future (and ended up merely serving as fodder on the fields around us). Yet how easily one forgets what is directly before one!

ACT 2: Luckily, I only have a few penetrable axes, barely safe river entrances and few usable roads. The empires that shattered elsewhere can never crush me properly … My rivers of tears bury their tragedy inside themselves and fall slowly into the South China Sea at last. Here funerary urns lie prostrate in scattered deposits amongst vibrant ruins veiled from us by noble desuetude.

ACT 3: I can reveal myself to the deep gaze that sees me. A different air wraps itself like silk around my landscape. Where does it come from so late? Though I am relatively ill used, countries far away stretch out their fingers towards me and kiss this virgin realm … Here streets become clean cutting pathways; shops with modern metal shutters spring up along previously bare routes; tall columns of smoke rise up into the hesitant light from new factories, workshops where men in white coats work attentively at machines … My life is portentous because it makes others happy anew … Nature rose up against us: tragic plagues reached laughable proportions and outdid us in panic. We got richer by our shudders which shook down deluges onto us again and again … The sacred right of giving oneself whatever death one fancies coupled very well with our unjustified sense of security in playing a useful role within humanity's great game enmeshing everything divined by clairvoyance between chancel- leries and banks, emporia gangs!
