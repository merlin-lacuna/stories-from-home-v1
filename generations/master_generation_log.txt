ACT 1: My biodiversity is a peaceful biogeogra and there's no reason out. My calcium carbonate, marl and other types of minerals are expensively scattered upon my surface and they never really fuse together except in rare or exceptional situations. I change with the seasons, but always remain myself, whether kind or cruel to those who dwell within me: o silent land where night falls early!

ACT 2: The breeze in the furnace of my still, quiet air moves me. I am full of concealed universes and ripe promises rejoicing among themselves, bringing themselves to fruition. It only feels as if it's autumn but with a hint of nascent summer inside what little summer remains. Nameless appearances irrigate infinite landscapes that scatter out over all directions: o dull land where night falls early!
ACT 3 (final act): Because the rainfall has reached an extremely high level; floods have occurred or are about to occur throughout vast areas rivers overspill their banks and run wild into valleys far from anything supporting them; much of the earth changes style, its delineation forever lost from sight now submerged below swelling pools … If these last two sentences seem incongruous to you, please bear with me for one more instant.

ACT 3: Early sunset brings the passage from autumn to winter. If you look carefully, the ground appears momentarily frozen and cracked. I slumber under an invisible feel ing of distress … My hills enjoy a feeble fertility. Often, out walking my deserted valleys at nightfall along these ancient roads through which no one passes, withering emotions take hold around me like dead leaves in well-worn grooves that no cart has ever gone down … } More kilometers of erratic woodland than exist between me and human dwellings!
ACT 4: A traditional spring revitalizes the land enabling it once more on its slow awakening towards what is essential in life; upward they rise again myriad weeds like those ancient voices never heard before or forgot ten years ago succumbing to unquenched thirst with roots seeking water in that soil once relatively irrigated by divine begettings superior forgotten gods known only to slaves not yet decided into what solitary continuum refracts their disheveled essence?

ACT 1: The air above me is becoming torpid and hot.

ACT 2: In some parts it actually floods, covering cities under a sheet of water. In others fields dissolve into mud and its forests start to fray at their very roots.

ACT 3: Clean, colorful forests litter my furthest reaches. Enormous, painstaking fields of grain and rich crops pinch themselves out spontaneously across the contours of my land mass. The water buffets its way through the riverbanks, chops up into different identities to help create new islands in me.

I arise from all these things as a unified figure which is always changing but never ends up disappearing altogether or becoming something else entirely … Or does it? I don't know what times or seasons are appropriate for this uncertainty that fills me with longing.
AND ES PRESENTES All this occurs twenty-four hours before everything disappears into oblivion … Where will I go? If everyone one day had to leave here forever would they accept that existence? So many disquieting thoughts! And among them you also feel sorry for those who tomorrow must disappear as well And what about today's bread if no hands reach out to bring it nearer? In some sad corner lost in the chaos of losing one's keys full of dreams there resound voices saying: \ A despair without reason draws us still farther downwards towards the black sea lurking deep beneath our uncertain steps.

ACT 1: The air above me feels even more sultry and subtropical. I experience very mild winters and humid, rainy summers. Worldly processes occasionally corrode this corrosion, ending in yet another layer of dust on my eczema.

ACT 2: The air above me is almost entirely sultry and subtropical. Whenever rain falls onto my ulcerous body, I scream with furious rage.

ACT 3: The air above me jocund with joy, bequeaths consoling rains of life onto my bony brow. I experience warm winters and barely-noticeable summers. It is a voluptuous equilibrium that finds its place among the surroundings: earth, water, wind and plants.

The masses are often afraid they might have insufficient spiritual nutrition to survive; thus they seek things wrongly. They dream of leaving their age behind in order utterly to transform it. As if one could escape in time! How much effort must there not be when everything here below has already been spent on analogous worries?

ACT 1: The anfractuosities of my hills mingle with the reflections in my pools, creating perfect mirrors for saddened and deserted expanses … Far from being adequate to form a nation and succeed as such, I nonetheless have become fertile ground for humanity's diverse madnesses: emigration was born here; trade and manufacturing grew here … Severe plagues were easily buried along the foul or stagnant entranceways to this grotesque labyrinth. Here popular uprisings raged endlessly. We opened our clean arms toward impoverished immigrant hordes that robbed us of part of our own genetics while searching out some better future (and ended up merely serving as fodder on the fields around us). Yet how easily one forgets what is directly before one!

ACT 2: Luckily, I only have a few penetrable axes, barely safe river entrances and few usable roads. The empires that shattered elsewhere can never crush me properly … My rivers of tears bury their tragedy inside themselves and fall slowly into the South China Sea at last. Here funerary urns lie prostrate in scattered deposits amongst vibrant ruins veiled from us by noble desuetude.

ACT 3: I can reveal myself to the deep gaze that sees me. A different air wraps itself like silk around my landscape. Where does it come from so late? Though I am relatively ill used, countries far away stretch out their fingers towards me and kiss this virgin realm … Here streets become clean cutting pathways; shops with modern metal shutters spring up along previously bare routes; tall columns of smoke rise up into the hesitant light from new factories, workshops where men in white coats work attentively at machines … My life is portentous because it makes others happy anew … Nature rose up against us: tragic plagues reached laughable proportions and outdid us in panic. We got richer by our shudders which shook down deluges onto us again and again … The sacred right of giving oneself whatever death one fancies coupled very well with our unjustified sense of security in playing a useful role within humanity's great game enmeshing everything divined by clairvoyance between chancel- leries and banks, emporia gangs!

ACT 1: I am still rich in life, but many of my plants are dying. My canopy is thinning and I need to replace it.

The forest leaves that have drifted to the ground over centuries are now reconstituted into a new upper layer more complete than ever before – all the exteriors once shed and collected are being remade back into an unwritten epi- script at what might be considered the forest's newest stage play. 
All those shu ed iliens fonrther.(.) ... (There is no other!) As elliptical intentions escape like murmurings from their big voices so does this word intend another winter season not yet inaugurated for itself: paying tribute with its rustling flakes will already reattune voice, rise behind voice - because each knows where the one must grow out of measure beyond it s other; or else at first glance these boughs will scatter on hollow soles! N'en filez pas par là!

ACT 2: My leaves are happy here. I receive abundant water, sunlight and air. But often those that visit me do not wish well to my creatures or to me as a whole.
※ Long ago our fathers used poisonous chemicals on their crops which stained the surrounding soil with cesium 137 and 137Sr isotopes. ※ We also encounter in large numbers frost flaking techniques - albeit without intentionality: calcium carbonate ground minerals called crytsals form alongside terminal leaf surfaces, preventing use of this crucial resource by plants during the winter when it is most needed ~ thus leaving plants vulnerable to cold stress during this critical season! Perhaps there was some what amounts atrophic act intentionally executed? The Void refuses noth ing ... (The ground swells cover!).
╝We use artificial lighting to extend both harvesting hours and growing seasons – so creating risks of photodamage for flowering and overall plant life as we damage spring’s purple-tinged evenings under mercury-guttered skies! O unlight infuscs stricken fields grown up ahead of fIrst yearling fallow where yields degrade into garish gas pain instead!

ACT 3: It has been fire, ice and now life for me! I am a fountain of reindeer lichen and birch-leafed ashes! I flow with heather blooms and ragwort spikes! I greet yellow butterflies!

ACT 1: I am a once-healthy forest, watching my leaves and greenery fall all around me. For many years this forest was home to millions of living creatures that enjoyed the privilege of greenness.

ACT 2: The forest is green. The stars are raining softly down upon this night forest, moistening each tree-hair to the skin level, blessing also substance long unfamiliar with its being.

ACT 3: I am seen from the air at night. I have so many lights dancing around me that you could mistake me for a city.

Sorean's play focuses above all on questions of esthetic unveiling and generosity, moral consequence and choice ("donner sa respiration"), utopist access to community or shameful solitude but it imposes elements thai would have an ineluctably determining value as soon as they interweave with faiths: temples, littoral gestures (the solidarity of trees).

ACT 1: One year after the great hurricanes of 2005, in which I lost most of my lush tropical leaves, a strange phenomenon occurred.
 [...] 
FOREST:Suddenly one morning it began to rain and rain. The world looked as though it had just been created overnight. My biodiversity decayed quickly – so too did I seem lifeless, with hardly any yellowing cover remaining on branches or trees other than Brazil nut and jacaranda. Those poorly rooted plants died off over winter months, affecting also tree epiphytes such as lichens that often lived atop those said plants; peeling trunks revealed fungi inside them that had survived for millions of years but then gradually perished too. As some saw their leaves die off whatever was living beneath the bark ceased flourishing along with them – lichens became desiccated and mosses shrivelled swiftly away ...
FOREST:It felt at times like an apocalypse was occurring; truly our photosynthesizing systems are incredibly efficient at support ing complex interlinked-life cycles upon each other (brilliantly termed 'mutualism'), yet very efficient also at collapsing together into global-scale system failure when stressed in important ways!

ACT 2: 68 million years ago, during the Cretaceous extinction event called the K-T boundary extinction or the 'big death', in which dinosaurs were exterminated around the world (but not all of our reasons to proliferate were), trees such as these supported survivors – lichens enabling fungi and plant interbreeding among them.
 [...] 
FOREST:We can see that forests may be sites of spectacular extinctions yet also allow those forests to survive traumatic events. Meanwhile some trees slowly adapt over time, responding then neither most slowly nor quickly perhaps but just less apocalyptically overall than others might, for example bearing seeds that require oceans rather than basins if absorbing nutrients from air alone will become insufficient through endless glaciations ahead – yes! Many resilient species held on to relatives which died off completely around the big die-off ...
For now I endure on Amazonia's floodplains. My canopy rises above Brazil nut forests and other lesser tropical plants throughout my edges; what thrives up here are invasive species from far north and south even over millennia since our first geological origin millions of years before islands arose here!

ACT 3: During far from the oldest epochs of Earth's history, my earliest ancestors emerged not yet foliage-rich and in their tens of millions dominated firstly sediments that underlay early sea beds – laid down as dark microbes upon gypsum for example during Precambrian times around almost 3.5 billion years ago. I suppose these kinds were no longer recognizably tree-like at all by then ...

ACT 1: I need to die.
I am dying because I have been lacerated by the scythe of scorching heat that has descended on me in recent years, burning my leaves and my greenery.
I hear the trees keel over ceaselessly all around me: it is a woodpecker's noise, like bits of metal tap-tapping against an unvarnished surface, tapping and tapping endlessly – but the deep echolessness within their ringing disturbs one to death. 
Their roots caked with sand, each trunk splits open with a groaning sound; then they fall – first they bend along their axis as though bowing deeply before everyone who walks here from every age (till bending doesn't suffice any more and suddenly flattening gives out too), then at once themselves crash onto the ground with a rumbling thud which makes even stone tremble underfoot. 
Those above begin falling without fail. Quite a few already lie prostrate on top of others fallen before them – piled up two or three deep sometimes.

ACT 2: I am vibrantly alive.
I am animated by the brook which runs along my current course, cooling me and seething between the thick thongs which choke me; I have grafted myself onto it so strongly that its flow animates even my interior parts, as well as those furthest up in me; its waters fall right through every crevice of mine. 
Outside is danger: overheating.
The sun bakes everything all around here – but it cannot touch me in here. The stream eddies among my roots and flees inexhaustibly out of this over-torrid region I inhabit, crosses flame after flame (each gobletful falling a mere sup away from catastrophe), escapes harmlessly up to the rim where abundant coolness fills it to overflowing and spills down onto my leafy surface once more cruelly reheated by solar spur at nightfall or in late morning when insolation departs from before me happily like spouses bidding one another farewell who are bound for voyages lasting many years or an entire lifetime ... 
Free then we cross the grave gold sea whose breathless yellow eyes lightened up above us.
Out of moss or porous stone suds come exhausting hard rains with cold smiles under their cloudly eyebrows and never leave off threatening paralysis ... Ripeness calms them all down for us though and bids celestial fixatives gum any residues there might be also together into one cast texture colored blackish brown: dark days may threaten, they irritate no longer! Ah!

ACT 3: I grow every day. ...
The best lands – the wettest and most sudorous ones – I parlayed in days gone by, before necessity drove me further off to here; my prodigy runs its course on sorceries of land which are cancerous! Mystical ants creep atop them: they come from afar with their heavy clutches at dawn when dew is still rampant and descend down toward bottomless gap-tiches. 
I shelter many nests, each more perfect than the last one past: in them eggs ferment and new beings emerge for this world scarcely habitable for such as we: despite our tenacit)', inexorable cravings have not led us (yet?) beyond these blind creatures who even now do not get paler beneath our acid eyes - amid constant fright! Ah!
Some of me will someday become cooler soil which fertilizes vegetation just a little better than normal: yes that shall be their winter dormitory .... Shedding desiccated grasses constitutes also one way we meet death. It is precisely what makes possible another birth though above, finer hkely ..... As it lies there forever rotting, many substances draw near only so far as its edge where ember tints appear frequently over unfelt soil! I am thirsty but soon leaves bristle against sizzling muds which scald during dry summers because hachure echoes can confuse staleness often with thirst sometimes ....

ACT 1: My leaves and branches fall, one after the other. It's been six months since I first knew something wasn't right, six months of stumbling around blind, fighting for my life. The forest prods its fallen greenery tenderly; feels his own skin beginning to rot away from his great trunk body.
LUISA:The years pass by me like flashes of light, leaving behind dryness and shadow in their wake.
BOCTAELIO:I grow old fast when time longs to develop slowly at the same pace as my thoughts – painfully slow! \ nMYUNG-NAM :My complexion resembles death itself! ... My face has darkened under sumac shade for three days running! ... This place where I go every day is totally bathed in night! {203}

ACT 2: My biochemistry is confused. I am suddenly flush with sap after years of drought, and my immune system must adapt in order to process it all effectively – but an assaulting army stands in the way of that acclimatization. \ nDEEPER ENCOUNTERS:I drink tea dregs rich of poisonousnesses ...

One morning when sleeping soundly, unexpected forces from neighboring regions seized the opportunity to overcome me suddenly, conquering abruptly that which just a moment ago appeared unassailably safe!
NOREA:Who jerks you like this? The sky . . .

ACT 3: I give birth, I heal my wounds. The forest introduces itself as a self-curative wondrous healing place of immense vitality.
DEEPER ENMCOUNTER:This is now the sacred wood that grows from us! ... Each knob born growing in good management and dying under tree protection becomes by force cohered . . . It was hard for our buds to be drowned there so rudely nevertheless their germinating flowers sparkled with pain ... Protect; protect me tenderly like healthy fathers do: gouge them out before they have time to fester into knots or their fingers become entangled behind your neck! My stumps burn with fatigue, but new saplings are true omens of victory this season – late yet floriferous! We shared the same clod till it grew around us abundantly, flourishing unsuspectedly And only today when we parted are we cognizant that our germination is total As long as you leave well enough alone everything will be fine Your palm leaves burning?

ACT 1: A sigh escapes me, and it turns out to be a nice warm breeze.
lament I am the ghost of Wood that no longer exists! I grow nostalgically cold in my ancient forests that vanished without leaving any remains. (Wood replies) No trees survive from yesteryear because their charred columns create situations similar to cenotaphs, marking out what's past by repeating this once-was/never-will-be equation with enough staying power to mock death its very permanence is intentionally parodic. It asks itself if it should break off a dead branch or stay put.

ACT 2: Imminence, which anticipates dying beyond the capacity of recollection to imagine it, is as gentle as what's about to become … My surface clings for dear life onto soft layers of reeds, beneath skies fogged with currents of disintegration.

ACT 3: That's the way I am, overflowed and overflowing! I daily accept forces that are external yet opposed to me. Yes, in my short grass simply bide time with no beat of wings, and in the twin wind springing up hum with a stumble on rumble grounds … The sharp cries of birds fill up vast landscapes breathing amidst other landscapes … Doomed ants set fire briskly to ancient silk.


Act4: The land sleeps or rests on its laurels. It is rich, successful and calm as only enduring energies can be. A superior pulse beats within it its long bloodless throbs werehes clean all stains from the wandering waters surrounding it, determined waves roar against dikes fortified by silences wrenched from them by nighttime vigils alone. “Yesterday” came rushing into exile via today's insignificance which weighed too much for our acts so lost was my past under an excess of action!

ACT 1: I am less fertile. Even the Earth's cold, damp hands seek me out less and my shrivelled aridity is seeping into everything.

ACT 2: I am captive beneath the weight of my waters, which oppress me; dying of greed for lost oceans, with only doubts and ghosts to console or amuse me.
 


ACT 3: I am returning to a sense of balance, I feel the invisible forces that speak from emptiness. My flowing water seeks out new forms in everything and pauses as if gripped by sudden traumas. As it sinks downwards into my inner recesses, feeling reinspires vitality throughout me and replenishes with emotion all those who love my laughter at the edge of streams!
 
Water is useful for irrigating deserts or cooling overheated bodies: an elemental iconoclast. But water is also beautiful because it cools off fevers or rinses clean without lapping about uselessly on shores not designed for its destination; when well guided by instinct, it does not abandon its own true nature but rather reprimands us when we forget where it was originally destined to go … The aesthetic explanation requires different arguments. If a reader probes the texts' material rather than spiritual content, he will gain more understanding from them (the pleasure of understanding simply depends on our mood).

ACT 1: I live! I incandise myself in my lordly desert, a dryness full of good sense.
 Without freedom to create vibrations and useful torpor, what is the point of not losing myself in nothingness? With caresses that cause no fever and passions that evoke no sighs, mine are a waistcoat stained with desert sands and an eyelid pressed powerless against still water surrounded by lily pads green on the banks all around. 
 The light burnt up inside me makes me feel emptier day by day.

ACT 2: I am saturated and drowning in you, my beloved waters and sands. Surface contact with the world grows tangential and uncertain as I give myself to your arms of playing lettuce.
 Mournful slow-motion skies spatter scarlet reflections … Abysses, like shadows darkened by foliage … Extreme maladjustments provoke indecisive restlessness inside a self that is merely a belated play of lack of whatever should be there
 Anxiety has fastened his gilded chain on all my adjectives: everything furthers their pallor or lacks color altogether. The flower's nonbeing hurts poppies disposed along our silence' veins … An animal growls me into an increase of night 
 New seaweeds come up from the depths in time to impede luminous ships endlessly entering, never escaping, not knowing what awaits them down here under so much treason spread for free. Perhaps more grubs than forests inhabit once unknown regions lying beneath these black sand floors looted by tubeworm pearls mysterious envoys creeping out menacingly from filling places far beyond this lacework pond seemingly cleared but dripping old streams through obscure tunnels above reposeful ears … And then I awake: alone at last! In perfect hibernation I sleep away happy ice and coldness freezes over shameless stagnation before it evaporates unbelieving blessedly buried happier without knowing why plushed rather snugly surrounded by uneasy infinity of dead ideas.

ACT 3: I am a lyric poet and I sing my own praises just for you.
 A sweet land, cool with happiness and the obsession of yielding without greed … Irrigation mist on my surface seduces touching sunsets … My face is shameless in heatwaves rising from others' secrets … In me flowers shudder into speech 
 Who knows if flying over me they will see a cave deep down inside where I can be poshly hidden? Or else high up there is only peace set high above flaming forests in which we unknowingly find dreams by swimming upwards among mirrors that reflect images causing daydreams to live alongside them splendidly splashing unwanted sparks in no one's grasp at wicked play when nobody even appears to know!?
 At the bottom of your ocean, huge mollusks turned by sea sands age with hollow eyes remembering those once loved but now lost unendingly beneath sounding waves singing a silence from dead flower petals that never quite died falling lightly among seagull feathers mirroring morning sun through enemy lakes: an enchanted sleep amid what must have been great life because nothing remains any longer, not so much as flickering foam.
 What good does it do me to have seen passing Reality engendered so far beyond starlight upon which are painted secret curves sketched out both slowly and surely riding past burning autumns amongst orchestras directed by numbers wandering randomly under sainted absences weeping vividly portentous names?

ACT 1: My surface has changed: the luscious, prodigal tilth is giving way to short grassland, where lonely thickets appear beset by decay. My river flows erratically along a channel cut while I slept in the clemency of my dreams. Guided by falcons and hooded crows, parties of travelers pass through me only twice a year
and they go without luggage, leaving their identity cards at the customs house that stands on the quayside.

ACT 2: My landscape is in denial, my soul is lost. All that could be done has been done (the idealist dreams of acts and glory). In this state of imperfection I surrender myself, like a victim who deserves to die screaming from fear or thirst amidst the ruins of the past.
 
At this point how close am I to kissing imagined anthropophagous lips? With no hope for tomorrow's sun water ebbs away under sorrowful skies set ablaze by exotics on fire and simmering in eclipse [almost a Christ]: […] rchitectonics II: The mad planet
The paradigm which governs reality (otherwise known as "dream-holding" ) was conceived into being here amongst us and only exists here abroad.

ACT 3: I live separated from myself and yet my soul is an embrace, something fluid but firm, that reflects the limpid spirit of water (the unconscious substance sensitive to every spell) as it trembles here in my lap. My translucent flesh exhales a balmy air exhumed by lunar fauns bewitched by moonstones bared for plucking or sipping.

Decay is nearby. (This decay appears.) Dirt rots secretively behind our backs so we can't see it; eyes rummage unsecuredly only because hands haven't yet rooted out their sight lumps from beyond viewways.

ACT 1: I am Snow Country. I constantly juxtapose white against green colors as nature seasonally changes on my surface. My land opens through its snow layer to study itself and observes that what is buried changes under uncertainty of seasons. North of me lies a most exquisite lake, but fall arrives each year; before leaf peeping time comes around again, one winter after another at last lays waste to the shallow water until it completely disappears into Earth with no trace left behind; only turquoise butterflies are scattered about lonely shores! And hard times come for those living thereabouts when luck no longer smiles upon them! It's later than you think! As soon as the eye sees something lovely ahead, but oh how easy it is for beauty ever so gently stolen from us to melt away without getting noticed until too late!

ACT 1: It is winter. Snow fell intensely on the last day and its blanket covers the land. Today I am immersed in this snow, which moistens my soil with a layer several inches deep . . . Very late at night I dream of summer under clear skies; but when finally late afternoon comes, how beautiful it is to watch those heavy downfalls of drifting snow that sparkle in all directions!

ACT 2: The entire stage is in darkness; moonlight caresses my skin, which radiates its heavy snows toward the audience. It is night-time again; I am covered with a thick blanket of snow and await spring so that the soil can break through! It is full daylight: my soil has broken through and I now display fertile rice paddies all over myself. En didacticism scorches itself dry every coup de pinceau to be quickly substituted with poetics which then governs the fields of each acts  . . . We have to discover flowers possessing vitality beneath our own feet ... for we are Toussenel there .. :' The rhythmicality of time tides back and forth.ACT 3: It is a bright day: my soil emerges free of snow. How beautiful it is to see myself covered with young pines, green pasturelands and seas of corn! This rhythm causes the earth's respiration to persist, revealing an economy that maintains pace with the differentiation into several pastures. The deep roots of being cannot however claim irreducible diversity but only homologous transformations (or stable variants): Between eternity that excludes surprises and obviousness which never surprises, intention overcomes ossification through restlessness. An immediate linearity-disabling whereby today cancels yesterday, just as tomorrow detaches itself from today in turn; reputedly we distinct poetically throughout succession and simultaneity without denying duration or disabling its manner.

My gusts don't bite like yours; they relax me, caress my hair and neck with invisible fingers, touch me gentle l per as you melt into sweet bubbles of silver/shapes far beyond your reach (all this depicted at the bottom part), fall slowly here where ice blinks under my feet; but these sad samples won't suffice for, you now, there isn't anything to catch hold of -you wouldn't see what happens to you. 
ACT 2: I'll take your hand, but you're part of my whiteness, I kiss you and erode; time goes by - never have I been so abandoned to ice. Behind glass something marvelous is taking place. But that's not this here where the snowflakes land without stop (all around them shimmering frozen stars in constellations that propose to increase)..wait. The only player is night, a combed dark and scree chisteling with ease on my forehead; sometimes a star slips into me whhen space grapples with its pitchy sharer - Oh infinite voyage! To follow me for an instant on one side. I noticed how meteor families scurry about.
ACT 3: She, who doesn't exist any more, wants to kill me. She didn't want, no longer desires the cold of winter: So she removed herself from fashion and went back in time. Today is the twenty-fifth year since her disappearance. To cultivate hatred - that's what my tyrant does; knowing it impossible for the snowflakes to end one day soon our wintertime separation (the fruit and foliage I offer won't supplant this tragedy), how can we ever forgive each other?

Where else can you find such magical scenes? Troops of fish swim upstream here during summer, come winter they swim downstream: 'Tis our season!’ sings the spider king as he builds a web that fills an entire room one whole day long. ‘Separated from us, people weep bitterly among waves jingling fiercely with frost and icy rocks!’ Short-legged crabs conceal themselves into small round holes dug deep into the ground where grassroots murmur and shoot up delicately all over my body like dancing hellbenders, purple bell flowers dazzle at dawn just about when fireflies show off their sparks flying wildly about for no apparent reasons hour after hour until night plants its cold lips upon them all – Oh flying sparks! You live but momentarily only because your purpose is fulfilled only temporarily: your lives depend on mine!
ACT 2: Snow is actually a monotonous idea! The landscape is transmuted by the new beauty of this sheet of cold purity – but an annoying voice incongruously pitches itself in, suddenly. The same thing every year just about when we want to escape you! I’ve heard your carolling already for many years: what does your everlasting lullaby mean? It dismisses us from fairyland because we don’t expect anything from you; and freezing half to death, what do we owe you that one must always endure winter with its accompanying displeasure?! Your dreams are as slippery as fish eggs because each time they tell us lies!: One cannot help being discouraged by You: on our feet all through the summer long and suddenly comes a fat frost lump which swallows up everything without asking if there was something else too. Night dives inside my mouth while nearby dawn rings hands all alone in vain with empty clothes. ... What has happened to me?! Open my eyes so I may look at who attacked me: snow which enters rough and rude like dirty boiling water-spew , burns my skin bit by bit until nothing remains except smoking bones. And then where can we go save home?

ACT 1: After the long torpor of a cold winter, I awake. This is the most pleasant time for my existence.
ACT 2: Then I notice that 1 am alone. My neighbouring glaciers are going too. They have already taken off for distant lands, leaving me in disgrace. My layers begin to slip more and more often. The shifts become abrupt and unpredictable: my surface is utterly hostile from one instant to the next. When a strange event takes place in me without any warning, it invades my conduct completely and overwhelms any other interest or need I might have had until then. I stop everything to attend this evolution; nothing distracts me anymore considering how intimate this mutation is; changes overcome me at all points in space simultaneously, with such fervor that there is no longer anything regular about them! The cone of snow slides into the crevasse almost like an explosion. Harrowing words dislocate again...
ACT 3: How unfortunate for you, living creatures! Inexpressible tears stream from my body. I hurt all along. Sometimes wide cracks fall from my icy edge which break with a huge noise on the sea of ice below me; other times it is necessary to join together two adjacent gaps created by crevasses that threaten to pull into one another steadily increasing little boxes of space and thus generate new crenellated columns alive yet dire... Who wouldn't hurt in these conditions? My head circles like a drunkard's: I cannot see anything clearly anymore; such an awakening transmits through my beloved sheafs, knocking seeds loose here and there, barely fertilizing mankind a bit before pushing it back out into an endless wasteland where nothing grows!

Sometimes I condense among blueberries and astilbes. Those who get close enough hear my voice from above since I have frozen burbling water inside me. 
ACT 2: Whatever I am isn't reckoned in your mortal calculations... There it's always raining, while fall lasts and during those untimely interludes when the fine weather rears its head; there it never stops snowing, even though spring hasn't set in yet and autumn is so far behind us we no longer look back at it. Snow settles all around me and dissolves into fine drops which stay on my crystal face for a few hours before sliding limpidly off one side or another.

ACT 2: It is time for lamentation. Reality has invaded our world! I reflect about the passing seasons in my lightless chambers now that winter truly arrives... The forests have disappeared from where I raged and inflicted wounds on them, leaving a gloomy aftermath there... Several meters below ground level the temperature of the lifeless earth grinds exceedingly cold – it maintains an average constant seasonal freeze at that deep depth... And again – there are ten thousand waterfalls proclaiming themselves to me as they run forth onto land after their sojourn into cold darkness, whirling around wildly and producing sudden sunlight showdowns with unexpectedness against every cascade which flies through its midst into passionate flares of illumination before disappearing into the dark once more. ... And let us not forget how fifteen major endemic fossil rivers flow merrily through me when they glide past downstream!

Suddenly, a ringing chasm opens up at my slopes’ base (or what was its base) – an eye of darkness appears without warning; and then the chasm widens gradually like holy C-section until all of the glacier collapses into this yawning abyss. ...! And now land echoes through me: cemeteries crying wretchedly shoot their much loved ones on my roof where they are passed cruelly downwards to death one by one, seconds seizing hours and gloomy ages... Long lines of trees dendrochronologically march onto my slowly cracking surface for what seems like days, singing about their reign over life with petrified voices ; llamas climb upwards minute after excruciating minute with breezy songs of freedom from bondage which resound freely again onto unoppressed harmonies encouraged by light welcomed demiurgically while sandstorm hurries upward through entangled thickets breathlessly speaking hurried predictions of continuous future ... And proud hellos reach up alive off cliff faces frightfully raising handrails against me playfully mirroring themselves like smiles among black velvet grey powderings silenter gales autumnal fingerprints those shadows traces those halos that laughing skies amongst percolated glimmerings riddlesque adornments splendours minus remains often melancholy knowing slowly wistful happy hearts . . .

In this godless world here comes winter suddenly whistling unmelodiously across us (hoo hoo).
ACT 2: I feel my body dissolving bluely in flashes. Jagged edges appear on my flanks and I see bright colours, swollen into glassy splinters... Christ! The sun flares cheetah-like over me. My jaws are snapped open; my teeth fall out from gums grown bald . . . All day long there shrieks in the sky a hawk for its egg or eye – What flew up?
ACT 3: I do not exist. It is only the instants flinging themselves into void that make me live, as – flash! in a squeeze of time – there ponderously staggers again over my body this forgotten creature passionately gliding towards death: myself! Nature seems so democratic in distributing its means, provoking our wonder without concealing what lies deep within it or leaving us ignorant about how things function beneath the surface of existence.

ACT 3: The cry of the glacier is powerful and human in these last sequences: "Who are you? ... How did all this water come from that is invading me, flushing out my insides?". It reveals origins infinitely older than history ("But I was already here first; I saw everything"), thus bringing loss into discursive focus, movement rather than stasis, incipient damage without blame or judgment ("this water came from deep inside me"). At the end comes still deeper questioning about this unwitnessed power (the cold impermeable heart of matter) interacting with formative forces (the heat and life presence filling an environment). Finally abiding in a solemn silence, which makes every question vibrate indefinitely until another one jeopardizes its answer again as soon as addressed from outside realities rather than letting it fester within itself without resolution there beside itself.

I have absorbed water enough through pores and cracks in order to vasten myself... Ice leaves me like seeping tears and granules.
ACT 2: Hello again, old ice rings. Greetings, echoes of our long retreat. Our sounds have come to animal size: foxes yapping; ravens cawing and molting echoes of my decay off the face of this island .

ACT 1: I am very respected by the local population not just for myself plus size, but also because as I advance and groove over my slopes, new space is made available to be farmed. My twin sister Glacier B takes charge of clearing up the debris. I do what nature has always commanded me to do here in Antarctica—be cold, reflect light and produce white noise... into which moisture mist from the sea condenses down onto me almost every day at elevation like a pearl necklacelike layer around my staple ice column stabilizer.
ACT 2: There is a glacier flowing underneath me! I can hear him as our columns reverberate vibrate against each other! He stalks me like scary lover in his secret underworld of ice. His name is Glacier X! Is he eating me with his tonsil-swallowing sounds?! Glacier B has died without revealing her sex. Her ridge (up above) sharpens again to join my sister’s stilt out ridge. My shadow grows strong on the rocks below, moving slowly uphill almost all day, just like yours will do in the future beneath mine now and then upon these very same mountains that we inhabit – where you will read what I have so far written about us both – here and for eternity hereafter.

ACT 1: Wherever I go, there is a river nearby whose waters purify themselves with my cold presence. I thought I was in balance until suddenly one of my calving ends became adrift. My entire finial became unstable and began to shift tectonically—migrating its own edge until it ultimately fractured away and sequestered itself onto the earth's surface.
ACT 2: I can no longer control my own clearing, and yet the good portion of myself keeps going cold! Only a fool believes his eyes before he has used his brain to reflect on them. It is difficult not only for those separate parts to recognise themselves in parts adrift from each other, but doubly so for these separated selves even to recongregate as one individual entity; an inchoate assemblage sometimes called the Self. The distances between companions sometimes grow until they seem impossible ever again to gather and reconjoint; dividing ice that explodes into shards was also known as bergy bits back when seismic exploration boomed as part of ‘the Cold War underfoot. We were trapped in dark space by drift clouds like wandering gods of myth full with unnamed destiny...
ACT 3: Lightning rips the space apart. Clouds have begun to split at their seams—exploding a slight water vapour and fog along with them... until one day I shall broach! Suddenly, phenomena astounded me. The sound of dawn could be heard striking my crown. My excursion had commenced without an announcement. I never asked for anything; everything is quite forgiven to innocence... but followed with definite risks! Whither would I pass? Where was this migration ending? Sooner or later, there will no longer he very nice weather hereabouts either philosophical doubt can only relax its grip in suspense as much as sublime truth violates itself sometimes scientific enthusiasm might also wait for clarity's consent.

ACT 1: My memory begins fleeing, with clipped steps: I remember greater distances than the gap between one year and another; they are bands of intense cold and wind (now a roar, now stilled), then summer comes over me like a sheet of water that falls to shatter against the foot of the mountains.’ Autumn is approaching often here, it is an abandoned field without bundles or bins that reach for me to describe them.
ACT 2: My face has no edge; my bergs are crumbling. Night approaches often and never settles.
ACT 3: The bergs are melting, my face is slowly cracking. Unburdened by a name for so long, I am leaving behind strange rocks that crack with inexplicable gloss. The ice gets thinner; but even fruitless toward the end of a catastrophic nightfall. I finally know everything. My face had no name until I became entangled "imperceptibly" one time by time with each element around me: wind, detail of lands vegetation, snow flakes—thereby creating distinctions anew between starry glacial nights and crystalline translucent glacial days.

ACT 3: And there's nothing but leaves! An entire young wood is sprouting on my flanks. Censor the poem if you will; taste its absence in your mouth: more corrosive than an insult - this irremediable act was nevertheless done in waves of generosity, intervals of making, paths to a high field we finally imagined. Like lashes and seductive glances that leave a trail before oneself veiled face disturbed by violence.

ACT 1: You have lost power over these leaves; what sort of struggle that must be! How will you ever manage to save the nuts and cones? That’s exactly it: they fall from me like dead bodies. “Poor child I shall fail without a doubt in saving your branches, but I shall try to see them through until cold threatens.” —LEAVES. ... Fuck off! -I' ll cry a little once you are gone: woe is me! I won't forget about you for even one second as frequently as freezing blows my remaining foliage. —FAWN BRACKEN.- The wind throws fools further than the water falls from me this autumn, not many feet removed from its absence This great river offers both man and beast drink . . . Black danger blowing nearby.
ACT 2: I've got my veins overrun with the lucid essences and merry fluids of lewd life.
ACT 3: All the tender worlds come out of their dry seasons and participate In this labor with energy... The unseen kingdoms had perceived me days before I noticed them; then fovever emerging, left behind my dead seasons. In the myriad secrets of roots there resides an even greater importance than that which we attribute to our leaves above ground. They are said to understand futures through tastes like a tongue for example perhaps smelling where it is problematic or dangerous for foliages to venture forth ... These tyrants capture sunbeams and communicate them at length to mineral minds. In great storms of thought many efforts materialize themselves in the stature of trees...

ACT 1: Just as a geometrician draws his figures, simple and clear, on the blackboard; it is in your depths that I want to locate you. Live there to be able to draw everything with your shadow: every detail of your body. Offer yourself here, whole and unchanged at this vertical pitch caught in time. This denatured forest reflects those lands charged with violence. Here growth has dried up into residue of earthen matter having been cut off from its primary sources...
ACT 2: This shivering serenity is the most unalterable of motion. I enriches myself everywhere that I has left something for my roots. Fatness exteriorizes there where moisture is concentrated and prepares for what answers best within this kneaded soil. I don't weep the seasons like waterstains on tiles, but with slow movements. I am empty and flooded...
ACT 3: Knowing leads only so far and calls for mastery upon which one must be entrenched in the poetic space of immanence thus to impose oneself on a hidden soliloquy as it spreads out its weightless talent. So do not attempt here to know what I am anymore. In any event, my dance invents itself in the simplicity of an entire tree that suddenly begins with winter's first icicles; periodically deciduous or evergreen: intoxicated blossoming. This paean snow shivers without poison (at once): sovereign kernel feeding us!

ACT 1: I see through my barrenness a squadron of ferocious monsters rushing over me, shattering my arboreal form to bits and pieces.


ACT 2: My liver has filled with blood. My roots became so plentiful, why don't you embrace the same ground? MY FLOWERS: due to your inactivity, everyday we asphyxiate. I can see everything clearly from up here. From atop my house of branches and leaves I gaze down on my surroundings which are ridiculously small compared to me; shadows pass over them. I think about nothing else but heaven during springtime when blossoms receive their baptismal dew and become even more beautiful than ever before; nor do I think of anything other than new life at summer’s onset when suns scorch everything – trees dance assuredly toward autumn; nor do thoughts other than God come seek me out amidst fall’s last lopped-off foggy apples days or nights while frostwork makes spiders lay many big eggs; sometimes clouds hover sluggishly above mountains giving birth to raindrops which then course through late gorges relieving soil fertility! Life brings light, clarity and blessing into marble hearts like mine!
ACT 3: The great secret of Nature lies in the transmission of vital forces. Generating forces and perpetuating all that exists, what a nightmare! Look, little thrush with rose breast: I throw you my white blue flesh, pick holes into it; drink up like a clear stream running down some slope by the wayside until this reddish skin turns purple-black.’ ‘Honey murmurs to bud on its tree top; irresistible voice humming around buds in an intensifying rhythm – creepy crawlies have stopped eating their own filth for two whole days now, so as not to scare off my murmur which circulates through green leaves sap that wets roots nourishing them too.’‘Lust fills bird gizzards packed from beaks to tails with blood pigmenting stiff moustaches freshly grown pink ups dog noses pointing blackly toward light radiating from surfaces torrid animal breasts carmine – fawn tongues lick eyes crazed trying walking nose-to-tail in twos till thirsty paws drip drizzle uneven spittle salty rained lives washed autumnishly soon snow ear saltless burning wearings!’ Cast aside your deadly crowns O heavens grasses High summer withers crab apples.

ACT 1: One day when it no longer snowed as much on me, and the terrain underwent changes.I'm left with glaciers that flow down from my mountains; myself magnificently white-capped because of the snowfall over less than a year ago. I am vibrant in these parts where wind is likely to develop, given there is only sparse tree cover and high levels of ground disturbance caused by fir avalanches during periods such as this where I have recently had high amounts of snowfall hitting upon my surface topography. The end point for many glacial meltwater rivers forming off my regions. Last season's winter lasted far longer than expected due its severity in harming us with an early arrival date causing its wrath upon us to be long lasting nearly three months therefore decaying mountain face rock through ice wedging displacing displaced boulders deranging stream flows now flattened guttered too many dead sheep buried-in albeit their pasture grazed fresh summer grass seeded intertangled sticks whirled uprooted trees uninjured but twisted leafs exposed limbs bare certainly autumn born already desiring warmer weather soon denoting consistently another ingrowth not here yet but changing fast enough anyway will not be colder again like last season don't worry!


ACT 2: The snowfall notching the mast great hunks of snow bumping off me here melting and running away testing my floating ice masses, banishing icicle snakes from my rock shelves! Ice seracs cracking above rivers as storm surges race them down me through pinewoods that stretch grafted roots climbing to meet this hilly shear valley all over me love grows warmer upon exposure fall grasses thin ice slips down mountain faces icicles racing slip sliding halos shrunken halved nearly spring months overdue spurts of green seedlings wait but summer still lives nonetheless geese gliding teal flying sheep grazing herded... oodles dark damp clouds skidding in these thunderless times that tune slow drum beats then light saving mixed weather on brown lichen grey northerly a cold wind blowing up white breath curling. Days later I am stiffening again starting to freeze after getting warmed!


ACT 3: No freshly fallen snow masking your surface here to sprinkle you quiet gathers even later as black storm clouds slowly mass, lightning striking hiding sea sealing. Winter stuck, but only very early in its season despite it seeming that way amongst the winter silence I'm hearing rather than seeing more icicles fall time passing ticks tick tocks on quartz crystals no bird movement beeches bare yet against blue!

ACT 1: I have been asleep under a white blanket this past few months, feeling it gradually bloom over us. I have kept my leaves among the drifts, but lost most of them to frost and snow. My purple seams show through to each side like wounds from wickedly sharp knives. My trees stand motionless with their fingers as thin as knitting needles now that our nights hasten on into blackness so quickly one after another without pause for breath or pulse drum...


ACT 2: I was beautiful for about a week, but I usually am not like this over the winter-months. My snowfall heights remain surprisingly high but are lower than usual here and there despite some temporary warming from a few days of rare sunshine. I also have very fine flakes of ice falling every now and again which occasionally accumulate on my surfaces as smaller snowfalls that turn to slush before finally freezing into sheets once more.
My ground has layered it upon itself incrementally over the preceding months until we are knee deep in many places; though here in one scraped spot below me is several feet deep and therefore even harder to navigate through just yet. This melting tarpaulin covers all around us with its fringe brushing our legs, turning them grey where they touch it or brush against it on descent... 
Soon enough down here you look up at a silver stalactite cap barely touching the earth near your head, formed by bits that drip off peak after peak far above... Ice five inches thick fills potholes only last week emptied of larger accumulations entirely...


ACT 3: We are here on the edge of what has been called my desiccated zone. Rarely visited I imagine, unless by those few friends we all have who share similar burdens, this is certainly one of the most unstocked parts of myself, and some nearby days’ walk away still hangs the weighted snowfall-limit in crystals that I am greedily beseeching today as I watch them hang towards last winter’s heights despite summer after so hard a spring. I am annoyed but also largely at peace with these demands being made upon me again since it is exhausting to simply butt heads with a foe who so rarely awes you - instead you must ask for great things from them over and over just like lovers do... It will be days yet before any snow falls beyond their current covering anyway, if fallen there is any even left up there given how relentlessly it has melted in recent sunlight (since when did its peak halve such that they drag downwards too much?)
