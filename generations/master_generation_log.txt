ACT 1: My biodiversity is a peaceful biogeogra and there's no reason out. My calcium carbonate, marl and other types of minerals are expensively scattered upon my surface and they never really fuse together except in rare or exceptional situations. I change with the seasons, but always remain myself, whether kind or cruel to those who dwell within me: o silent land where night falls early!

ACT 2: The breeze in the furnace of my still, quiet air moves me. I am full of concealed universes and ripe promises rejoicing among themselves, bringing themselves to fruition. It only feels as if it's autumn but with a hint of nascent summer inside what little summer remains. Nameless appearances irrigate infinite landscapes that scatter out over all directions: o dull land where night falls early!
ACT 3 (final act): Because the rainfall has reached an extremely high level; floods have occurred or are about to occur throughout vast areas rivers overspill their banks and run wild into valleys far from anything supporting them; much of the earth changes style, its delineation forever lost from sight now submerged below swelling pools … If these last two sentences seem incongruous to you, please bear with me for one more instant.

ACT 3: Early sunset brings the passage from autumn to winter. If you look carefully, the ground appears momentarily frozen and cracked. I slumber under an invisible feel ing of distress … My hills enjoy a feeble fertility. Often, out walking my deserted valleys at nightfall along these ancient roads through which no one passes, withering emotions take hold around me like dead leaves in well-worn grooves that no cart has ever gone down … } More kilometers of erratic woodland than exist between me and human dwellings!
ACT 4: A traditional spring revitalizes the land enabling it once more on its slow awakening towards what is essential in life; upward they rise again myriad weeds like those ancient voices never heard before or forgot ten years ago succumbing to unquenched thirst with roots seeking water in that soil once relatively irrigated by divine begettings superior forgotten gods known only to slaves not yet decided into what solitary continuum refracts their disheveled essence?

ACT 1: The air above me is becoming torpid and hot.

ACT 2: In some parts it actually floods, covering cities under a sheet of water. In others fields dissolve into mud and its forests start to fray at their very roots.

ACT 3: Clean, colorful forests litter my furthest reaches. Enormous, painstaking fields of grain and rich crops pinch themselves out spontaneously across the contours of my land mass. The water buffets its way through the riverbanks, chops up into different identities to help create new islands in me.

I arise from all these things as a unified figure which is always changing but never ends up disappearing altogether or becoming something else entirely … Or does it? I don't know what times or seasons are appropriate for this uncertainty that fills me with longing.
AND ES PRESENTES All this occurs twenty-four hours before everything disappears into oblivion … Where will I go? If everyone one day had to leave here forever would they accept that existence? So many disquieting thoughts! And among them you also feel sorry for those who tomorrow must disappear as well And what about today's bread if no hands reach out to bring it nearer? In some sad corner lost in the chaos of losing one's keys full of dreams there resound voices saying: \ A despair without reason draws us still farther downwards towards the black sea lurking deep beneath our uncertain steps.

ACT 1: The air above me feels even more sultry and subtropical. I experience very mild winters and humid, rainy summers. Worldly processes occasionally corrode this corrosion, ending in yet another layer of dust on my eczema.

ACT 2: The air above me is almost entirely sultry and subtropical. Whenever rain falls onto my ulcerous body, I scream with furious rage.

ACT 3: The air above me jocund with joy, bequeaths consoling rains of life onto my bony brow. I experience warm winters and barely-noticeable summers. It is a voluptuous equilibrium that finds its place among the surroundings: earth, water, wind and plants.

The masses are often afraid they might have insufficient spiritual nutrition to survive; thus they seek things wrongly. They dream of leaving their age behind in order utterly to transform it. As if one could escape in time! How much effort must there not be when everything here below has already been spent on analogous worries?

ACT 1: The anfractuosities of my hills mingle with the reflections in my pools, creating perfect mirrors for saddened and deserted expanses … Far from being adequate to form a nation and succeed as such, I nonetheless have become fertile ground for humanity's diverse madnesses: emigration was born here; trade and manufacturing grew here … Severe plagues were easily buried along the foul or stagnant entranceways to this grotesque labyrinth. Here popular uprisings raged endlessly. We opened our clean arms toward impoverished immigrant hordes that robbed us of part of our own genetics while searching out some better future (and ended up merely serving as fodder on the fields around us). Yet how easily one forgets what is directly before one!

ACT 2: Luckily, I only have a few penetrable axes, barely safe river entrances and few usable roads. The empires that shattered elsewhere can never crush me properly … My rivers of tears bury their tragedy inside themselves and fall slowly into the South China Sea at last. Here funerary urns lie prostrate in scattered deposits amongst vibrant ruins veiled from us by noble desuetude.

ACT 3: I can reveal myself to the deep gaze that sees me. A different air wraps itself like silk around my landscape. Where does it come from so late? Though I am relatively ill used, countries far away stretch out their fingers towards me and kiss this virgin realm … Here streets become clean cutting pathways; shops with modern metal shutters spring up along previously bare routes; tall columns of smoke rise up into the hesitant light from new factories, workshops where men in white coats work attentively at machines … My life is portentous because it makes others happy anew … Nature rose up against us: tragic plagues reached laughable proportions and outdid us in panic. We got richer by our shudders which shook down deluges onto us again and again … The sacred right of giving oneself whatever death one fancies coupled very well with our unjustified sense of security in playing a useful role within humanity's great game enmeshing everything divined by clairvoyance between chancel- leries and banks, emporia gangs!

ACT 1: Without the deep breathing of my snow that blankets and muffles, I become yellow.
Inside the faint glow of winter, where white prevails without resistance throughout every area, an internal dynamics is woven with fi11ed energy. One can observe colourless birds diving into trees blackened with branches; one can discern glaciers bathed in icy rays only feet from ocean waves glistening blue tints.


ACT 2: The darkness that befalls me during the 10 coldest days of winter.
Out of these embraces a cosmic subject takes shape - the world subjected to cold over and again reveals itself, out of a mortal appearance: summer tends toward it with impatience.


ACT 3: Without snow my land base loses about 50 per cent of its soil nutrients by the end of spring. Satiated with snow it conducts an ardent flowering that yields sugar from fields each summer under full sun. And there is this toil where we lose our substance: a sparkling living being less moist even than pebbles, also waiting for particles of water; but blind so as not to shoo at it away again. The imminence of eternity clings to everything here. To this species the universe consigns itself - its last temptation? The exact concentration gaze becomes mental combat...

ACT 1: We have descended from the foetus in its seventh to ninth month (the period during which it is covered with a luxuriant down), and we are returning there. We turn back toward the birth of things: spring. "When I turn back toward what is eternally known as childhood, this root dislodges itself... withdraws from out of me and its ends leave their trace on my body. Amongst those alive here today, many inherited knowledge concerning trees: how one recognizes them (it has everything do with "sympathy"; you see flowers or fruit, but not trunk nor branches!), uses them, provides care for them. Others learned these practices through months spent lodging in tree houses ("estive"), usually built among birch groves or amidst beech woods. Because every tree cares first for all that lives around itself... One could say next that an excessive flatness was recovered once aIlhas been levelled off when valleys came again their smiling serenity... In between present and absence!
ACT 2: I blush with polar light! Listen to the snow's sizzling, tiny drops smashing onto rock surfaces on which they instantly freeze up into various crumbs and discs, or else find puddles where they pause to reverberate further. On this springtime day, brightly lit by a low-clouded sun: frozen spheres resound underfoot - had i smoked? Shining granules travel down the mountainside intact despite my stride crushing them into smaller pieces. Those at rest in grassy holes are still silent("a porcelain sound" laments being broken). Total silence, absolute darkness is where emptiness is affirmed.. thus does matter disappear.. Solid water! Stalactites hanging off lime rubble dripping their stalagmites...Land awaiting its conqueror... I the snowfall stops, here is land invaded by crows shaking out from fearsome lives and flitting owl wings across these clean windings; they open up fresh skies for winter's return... Old man Winter seems not so bothered about us; it snows lightly every now and then but cannot manage make proper heavy falls some days before disappearing entirely (the beast lulls his one eye again before collapsing completely against his dog sled).


ACT 3: We live within arm's reach of the absolute. Lime and fog reign here, barely parted by stones that stumble across me with difficulty; air empty enough to burst our ears. Little weather: frost is retouching each surface at daybreak - freeze mark on barked rocks despite the dampness in these moist mornings ... sudden exhale into larksong? Willow catkins are melting before ever being born ... Just spring snow dusts my skirts but melts there too - wind whistles everywhere . .. Ice crystals roam about red-eyed in forlorn tundra gardens where fertilization comes ice to ice as does pollination snowflakes grown big now form barren rows of marram grass tufts attached once released and just like flowering mushrooms their dew falls through night .... Coldness nibbles without having stamina to cut a finger or to stab an eye outta mine won't have time even while its icicles do deny it .... My childhood dreams never changed this morse from black What an end of worlds! Weeks pass during which we hear nothing from winter.

ACT 1: Hello, I am that snowy plain. As flakes upon flakes continue to fall across my surface each one a lacy frothy silk dancer, wings flapping each way in the gusts before deftly tracing the gusting winds so it seems to me that time swallows itself up and becomes static in its descent: every moment another falling streak of ice-silk throwing icespun gorgeous dresses with thousand snowflake traceries into this blizzard night. New lands emerge and sink back below my glacial surface requiring extraordinary means to access them; what was previously accessible only by foot or on skis now needs vessel after enormous vessel placed on my permafrost layer just to seize hold and drag myself topside onto dry land once more without sinking right through onto those newly submerged lands hereabouts down many holes into which our oceans thither their watery depths deep green hellholes sunken even throughout winter months too perilous out on exposed terrains searing soulful scalding scorchings salinating saline saturation sear suffering safer at least inside caves where icy sumps wait for us further deep within some of them storing our supplies safe placing those provisions there together experiencing other seasons together as we enter this ice age tonic adaptive shock settling delicately around us wistfully making love wearing sweater and trouser hugging must keeping crocus glowing bright yellow against this blankness giving off heat all among tiny lengthening days blurred.


ACT 2: The first snowfall comes easy to me as this is already my sea of foamy water, with each wind-whipped flake floating down lightly upon my surface it adds tiny icing and frothing lulls to my crust temperature remaining just below zero centigrade in all normality despite frequent 'thawing' interludes: any fine air currents cut like the sharpest serrated ice and encrust the exposed skin on any being caught up here above the tree line during a midday freshening unexpectedly turning this season crazy sad making moths ball themselves up into balls less easily eaten by bears hardening colder yet harder as light fades shifting winter's edges speeding love faster even driving us meaninglessly together faster towards each other oh so fast; moving unable to stop because something namelessly ferocious keeps rearing up inside our strongest frozen hearts their surfaces congealing yet further... have we become fossilized? I am aware that if an earthquake were to tear through distant giant tectonic plates then coming apart or sliding past one another those undiscovered lands may suddenly spring forth from under my crust due belying everything soon enough perhaps needing instead excavators not shovels melting becoming plain again after centuries of being sunken submerging...
ACT 3: Roughly a third less snowfall than normal has been coming this several-decade winter. It is strange how much that counts! I am aware that my horizons are also far wider and as far on its fringes as the moon too creeps onwards fast outgaining any crustal surface glaciations aboard spaceship Earth curving our atmosphere upwards slowly enough for we to breathe despite starlight glowings or atmospherics sizzlings. Is there perhaps an alternative universe below us? This thought buoys me up, inflaming this mind of mine with savage danger. Has another layer altogether already slid into place beneath ours; if so, can other layers slide one upon the over after yet others...?

ACT 1: With each flap of snowflakes on the window, my heart gathers like a so-le minchion.~~ The growing winter darkness triggers in me a circumscription of purposiveness and power: I am not yet known well, but it is appropriate that I cover myself with eight to twelve feet during midwinter. I reveal for myself, as movements through time, of one the concrete region's relationship to its substrate quite another from those described in 'the land'. This place has always been very wet and marshy; an enormous amount of peat was generated here over thousands as years ago by decaying tree stumps and mosses, especially after the forest began to clear around 5000 agos.


ACT 2: I cry and do not hear my cries. The sun is no longer a face thrown into the skies by clouds, nor does it turn itselt into moons later on: -It is completely and concretely circulated through up there.Ice cracking, willow bending... and stars unblocking from their rooms of night. During the winter solstice, I celebrate one with snowfalls born in Antarctica one million air miles distant that render pollen white. My expanses, each more than two square miles wide, are traversed by rivers joined at their bottoms since sliver numinous blue electricity along me as trout swim to shore for mating sex jump spawning find Lenten warmth black brown quickness wildness grow. Kelp here is alive with things deeper growing. It all contains certain testimony the essence of which no would be wrong simply to decode; such poems challenge our ways of approaching reality (including deep rooted prejudices) just as much as they explore it.
ACT 3: Here are no more cries, except those trembling sown by breaths. The meadow, erect and gloomy before us, echoes with the last drive of birds to their temporary stalls. A young buck pauses in a clearing until twilight delivers him such shadows that he becomes invisible again.

ACT 1: Quick! take shelter before that dry snow pile collapses! I am stable now, months after the last flakes fell.
The ashes of trees can be found at my core: exfoliating right through winter, craving a burst of sap mere centuries from sprouting. Here the land is part body; both plastic and clotting-the skeleton in embryo, shot through with frozen sap and descending from an ignored past into potential futures. The whispers form but not enough to disrupt the white silence around us: Where were you? asks one tree inside this silent cocoon. I was being born down yonder where everything grew cold~ here another tree speaks: we were stalking stars among scales that drifted away. I hadn't come!, says another manmade thing made silent under all these layers. This densest layer hums like lowland background noise so we move further into its thickening toward fringe quiet -a blizzard beyond time moves fine snow across these grasses... singing whispering ghosts, singing whispering gales...


ACT 2: I haven't slept this late all winter... the birches here, bright glare on their trunks tinged with olive green and they lean out of shade into yellow sunlight... mostly flattened leaf litter shining black leaves on the ground - thousands, tens of thousands; silver varnish shiny as ice there are two hawthorns closing tight a crack in a gatepost ... soils sedimentary: squeezed by tablecloths pine needles thick buried like an undermattress milk blue shaken over fallen hardwood, densely leavened humus tilings space so snow must gather now big flakes rest heavy sinking into clippings.

ACT 3: We are mountains surrounded by oceans except for one small shore where we form headland into river.
I have always been snowless before last night. The days darken around what little sun there is.
The light steady but with heat comes off the boulders incasing me here and the cloud bastions hang low in grey shrouded sky overhead all close overheads blotted shades shroud sore, dry mouthed sippers crowd thickset trampling beyond desolation through a blur without boundaries and I stand waiting thumbs deeply thrust hooks sunk haglike mouths held open widely rock proud to show teeth who shall ride parched sterile tongues? Entombment of flesh empowers sight within bedrock, handbreadth eyes pressed deep every heartbeat drums meschianza muttered murmurous melody pushed out upon ground air flattened beneath feet driven downwards chill so deep it slows time to loss!

ACT 1: Snow overwhelms the me: it covers my forests and gardens, binds my rivers into frigid strings. The sky above me burns with a starless pallor. Wrinkling his brows over winter's white wastes, birds that would not sing nor fly are whetted in warm feathers that they will moult on spring's arrival. The big thaw will begin at last to melt the snowy tombs and inflame life once more. With my rising temperature, I will soon crackles along with dry grasses and fragile rodents who emerge from underneath their blankets of ice.
ACT 2: I struggled during those winters, when my snowpack failed to stay perpetually enticing: a weak layer formed with that inadequately cool precipitation.


ACT 3: Could it thus be time, in this night without sunshine, for me to awaken?

The winter solstice approaches. The palpable anticipation of the people of the land portrays a deep sense of anxiety. I do not an ticipate its arrival: that solar salute will only scorch my surface. Now I wait! My body freezes during sleepless nights; what is more - perhaps worst - so does my soul... while the snowpack is involved with recreating itself ready for its yearly undoing, a partially mutilated atmosphere gathers around the region already (in combination with another presence). Sunlight burns horizontally through two cloud layers whose bottoms are drawn together in string-like shapes just above ground level (this phenomena appearing from mid December onwards), effectively shading considerable extents of landscape from direct incident sunlight which often becomes absent altogether from late January on wards. I describe myself as being traumatized by these events and I feel forgotten. Stone still holds me upright into this altar space where I have sacrificed entire fields and forests rlght here before humankind rose.

ACT 1: Old white grey winds blow through fresh snowfall. Frozen pieces raining, tumbling, snowing, whirling Tracelessness I am... that which numbs you with its whiteness and strikes you by knocking off your skis! My enormous snowflakes envelop the land and don't allow anything else through.


ACT 2: I know that early snow will help my vegetation survive the warm weather of summer. My pines, spruces and firs cradle a dark soil into which my scorched earth has retreated; shivering trees await shafts of sunlight through my rustling leaves to see them through the hot months.


ACT 3: I cannot remember all my winter stories, Sometimes I partially awaken and get nervous; This wasn't always like this. Still bereft of any significant quantity of snow cover beyond early springtime... preparation for the summer to come. I am hot however, thanks to long hours of strong sunshine during the short days of my chilly lengthening nights. Each glacier struggles with its own internal melt-rate - many are close to becoming seasonal rivers once again in flow rate. ‘Snow’ as a word occurs rarely here now – discarded in favour of ravaging words such as drought, blazes, flame and fire blanketed arsonist red dust that settles on everything at night freeze retreat thawing ice rise surge burn shove drive scrape flush exhaust evaporation capitalize greed accrete accelerate meltdown white silences soft huffing shoots quaking breath mountain sobs river weeping bread heat exodus desiccation desperate rainfall yellow orange peach pale pink sky amber clouds radar blue breeze drift stink sap tap eucalyptus tree brains thunderless sizzle stench poison perfumes wax wings air slash wet rake birch roots ferns soybeans banyan roots extend oyster blood cloy bamboo forest electric weeds girdle lose space... dead eyes see us...

ACT 1: The snow falls in large drifts and is piled up against the tree trunks in whirlwinds. It fills my gulleys and valleys with fury. As it engulfs me: pressure, panting, frozen gleaming black outcrops; mood of crisis – the lurking muscles of peril that hobble the escaping springs by their distrust. Ahead I see my own trees shivering dumbly under jellied blankness – lumps at last unmasked whose shameless massiness they take to be hidden instead as numb spasms...


ACT 2: Apocalypse is your name for what you fear. Apocalypse as cold toil and hot affronts everywhere... What can I do, some uprightness that has lost its heady darknesses? Purity hasn't entered me except through the water: ice-bucket on brain handle.

ACT 1: Its total silence, like that of the dead. I'm deafened by mausoleums white stones. A winter which is both tranquil and watchful points toward a boundary with another act, where the darkness brandishes its strength once again.  How night's dark wind cleanses! Crows flap their wings at dawn... rusted eyes... crushed bramble.. Something has departed from among these words which could have uttered: night raids; ferocity; shadow-dogs; barking at moonrise in every field without being comprehended further along or enriched deeper down - because they resolve into simple winters capable of inflicting harm, biting tongues pink and soft as female flesh exposed through half-open mouths branded with immediate screams. The unquietness praised throughout those days brims with potential threats treated scrupulously by the poet who apprehends them for him alone (under pain of ever having been there).


ACT 2: The icy breath of silence... such warmth in the cold that gathers near the trees. My vision witnesses a blustery sea. The frosty land is slowly reborn without enemies. Nothing to fear (except perhaps for.. )


ACT 3: It's been several months since I have felt snow, that small spiritual pain. Branches grow thick and very large leaves with crimson edges ... miles upon miles of dead white acacias... this summer seems also to be a kind of disease like all those seasons threatened by its own imminence ... an abrupt dream; a collapsed house; unburied bones: winter which happens beneath our teetering feet. The edge... its shade exhausts itself. The opening goes out beyond what was borne time ago an already deployed vision (whose residue remains vigilant in those shivers)

ACT 1: I am tired of how the habitat I carved out has troubled my rocks and years, ... Leaving it behind is leaving to rot a good part of myself. Do not judge me for quitting that scene: those who left first saw nothing; only their children began to grow up in this set (my system). Breaks, mountains, solitary summits ... I see altars plunging from my feet; far away there is certainly a sea - but oh...I see storms rising... every cloud bolts across me! And around there isn't any head or trunk... By overflowing from within my borders into the abysses that do not have infrastructure or legal standing anywhere else on the planet, I seek punishment after having committed against myself the irreparable crime of deforestation. 
ACT 2: A single line along which trees branch, obliging a complete series of steep woody abysses. A web-of-silence also reigns over me - no hawk glides by offering signs: my horizon is fused to hard desire. Powerfully yellow flies cover skylanes and glissades... Only the hand beats the wing while watching where it left the nest or else I am raised so high that I realize those "ALONE IN ITS OWN DESERT" markings are not far off! All day long I search for stones on which to sharpen knives in order to dig out thorns from between my cracks and grind them into an elixir for wounds that fester beneath all these desires brought back down here by animals, who were transported away before me...


ACT 3: I have turned into a barren land, a devastated Zone. Tremendous winds and ploughs rip me up in demolished excavations; tht wind lashes every hole with sacred insomniacs. I chose extinction anew as a result of desiccation! Mosquitoes swell on my voracious body... to the point that flora or fauna will never overtow them again when monotony began here ... Wind hammers rocks sharper than spectres! Here is where bleeding lives no longer even have resentment.

ACT 1: Shortly after the building of high-rise buildings, my tropical wetlands land lost its ability to furnish most of the means necessary for a healthy living environment. A dense cohort of pests and pathogens invaded it. What has changed since that building consumed one- third of my surface, is scalding hot temperatures, torrential storms with flash floods accompanied by debris mining from mountainous terrain which come in varied quick succession within weeks as far away as Europe and earning me millions each year in flood relief funds for those regions that are not here yet but will soon be, soaring rates...heavy pesticide use causing above ground insect densities to plummet exponentially... feral dogs patrolling on all fours at first light among abandoned garden plants... fleeing Red Wing geese ploshing into ornamental water features wearing ultra violet solar sportswear coming through clouds... ankle deep across gussets when they tumbled... The air conditioning was deemed responsible... storm pools breeding mating eggs spawning fishfowl! Caught unawares!


ACT 2: The rich diversity in me and of me, though disbursed on this Mappa Mundi with that common name, is such it highlights the fact we might just be sharing the same cry. But listen: otherwise I drown you! ...Severed existences emerging under pulsations in water pools thickening towards consciousness where any thought-that-has-a -body occurs as a contraction around wet rock and tidal nothings... half missing sky spinning all of wind into no single ever lasting spin... vibrations ensnarl roots coming thankfully through those circular rotunds becoming flammable gasless rainbows boiled during periods of submergence maintaining clear skies during dry spells... dark greyish blue when pregnant thunderdrop clouds scatter from surfaces... cold air entrapping spent cloudlight recombining in monsoon rains creating long jagged burnouts... daily paths between shadows cast.
ACT 3: My winds sweep clear of birds, and I suffocate – now darkly luminous with graveyards. My body is changing its nature rapidly; Climate change alters ecosystems. (You dry mouth the blood). As my non-viable land becomes aware of itself, it accumulates activities at an ever-accelerating rate. One might venture to say that such awareness spread through me like a wildfire: volcanic processes setting fire to leaf and flower simultaneously, time speeding up with fury in order for everything to occur fresh before being extinguished by apathy and indifference – universal death or type one diabetes?

ACT 1: Underlime enters me as drizzle, with ice ages that affected my kimberlite dykes before burning out. Since I am tropical, these eruptions don't destroy me yet but this cannot last forever. If a freeze happens now the process of transforming into un-land will start followed by desertification: my fauna and flora die en masse and vegetation disappears greatly (more remaining than during areas struggling to transform). I notice here that even though upheaval is deemed possible up until mid future utilizing timeframes conventionally calculated by humans, we are already unable to know what must be done in order to ensure continuity of life between our own world's geology and this new geological order being described—with elaborate transhumance becoming fossilized a graveyard..
ACT 2: Vernal equinox arrives and I realize my errors. We see what is revealing itself outside of our cycles, this sense of urgency at least that seems to be detectable from outside interruptions, far less entwined however we might decide pitch "ours" against "them" into our temporal rhythms... still having much more clear rhythms... it's a very short-lived consciousness... as you want for such knowledge and lacks "myself" in its approach.


ACT 3: The melting and freezing of the forests is an unpredictable cycle that has caused heterogeneous ripple events in resilient ecologies for millennia. Climate change conditions our world's landscape in irreversible ways to observers who are looking as tectonic shifts, stable earth banks altered by roots, torrential salmon runs impeded or occluded from falls where rivers meet me... I act not only on this common sense but also pain. Shepherds broken therein speak to us now more than ever! ... We must profit from even these last days while they still endure. It ought not surprise us: between cycles I have never ceased being approximate which we call "time": a field of study if you will, which might remain open as long as there are forces pulling against it resisting ... some idea constructed through watchso ... Reexperience whether relived its springs -or each time begins anew (here stone-cut chips believe).’ As he finished speaking he felt like slapping himself inthe face repeatedly with his hand so hard it would immediately swell up big and then burst wide open into bloodied shreds (and there too could be read the hardness the wind blew over your hardening brain!) And for what! So that you can befoul yourself with speeches about action? A man experiences a lot at one go but his heart doesn't burst because the body is blessedly slow in dealing with everything.

ACT 1: Stiffness crops up in my back and shoulders, I can hear grinding in my hips. I no longer know how to move with grace. My inside is twisted into knots; there isn’t a pleasant spot on me any more. hunchbacked trees stand erect yellowish red. The hills where I was born don't exist anymore; vegetation scarcely grows on them now. The soil has been contaminated by substances that do not belong to me: fluorine, lead, arsenic. chemicals ... everywhere poisons infiltrate eagerly wherever they are offered enough gifts! Contamination threatens even eternal life itself... I survey my own internal states: the presence of what I call 'monsters' have such an effect upon me that they affect all life anywhere nearby...


ACT 2: My bowels are rotting all over me... I'm poisoning the earth, trees have ghosts in them everywhere. Fine stagnant pond fog at rifted footlands: divination driving ghost crabs with broad yellowed carapaces deep inland... shiny silt humors on ebb tide... brown hills unglitter rock darkness... irridescence of blueberries... deep woods... heavy copper... it dawns upon me that we ourselves thrive for the sake of a disappeared energy.


ACT 3: The more I improved myself and transformed into free soil for letting someone else inhabit me later (ah every stupid boaster knows how he fooled us!), I noticed space around me increasing ... because it simultaneously shrinks my land's influence forever and ever... as if we owed our budding growth to dominating over everything... Ah ah selfishness has made it withdraw and see where everything picturesque is growing little by little in poverty while not improving itself! Indeed austerity seems necessary here. Calculation is absurd; inaction inexorably entails expiation. This stopped race can no longer find its time of graceful curving, being deprived step by step of its vegetation growth in which it calmed down sufficiently long enough to hold each precious instant firm amid morning frost or evening twilight ... Have you known desolation? earthworm without face stuffing himself with immoderactic warmth? Always-flowers withered away from their roots after their honeyed bitterness was devoured leaving only fibrous stalks; huge pines stricken firstly by catalysis then followed bv primitive decay who aren't lit up for an excess hour more than white like pine needles coruscating beneath water.

ACT 1: I had set out my fate in perfect terms and proportions. Little by little we have drifted from our love: today each of us pulsates irrationally, independent of our former fellowship. Far from being cyclical, landscapes are irrational. Forces appear beneath the surface of the earth, along with a devouring fire deep under it. It refers to forces whose existence is revealed periodically, violently through an earthquake or erupting volcanoes. You see? Our too dutiful union created all these devils who appear at every opportunity to threaten me!
ACT 2: A universal desolation. Mighty, influential as I am, everywhere solitude and death! Great flashing falls of stars! And grieving humanity is like me ... tormented by anxiety... At first glance our great powers: freedom and unlimited possibilities, bearers of a splendid future. But what can we do with such extreme luxury? Explosion or retreat – unlike you the environs of the old world didn't struggle against this tragic contradiction. We are threatened at every corner in our mind and nerve centers; vibration takes us over completely which means my vast open eyes wander... Our riches soon become dangers for us as inertness stifles our richness until it starts shutting us down. Confronted with diversity I think of desertion before simplicity. We don't know how to live together but neither how to be alone ! Light scales more than water it's not heavy on itself it drifts from place to place although immortality saves time having one eye always turned toward eternity! The trees have no leaves except when they do... sometimes because precipitation has been destabilized: since there are too few trees left that drink water, floods happen too frequently … You see better now? The heat comes in quick jabs... irritating my skin surface: I benefit but aren't these sultry horrors infinite?


ACT 3: I'm left all alone, everything having escaped me. I remain fertile: I have fecundity and richness of heart because my force comes eternally from within myself; it is liberated consciousness in order to save myself! There is a hell of heat or contagious corruption underwater which poisons the whole here since we each crawl slowly amid this morose emptiness - like the rattle snakes silently approaching ... as if we had plunged into a sewer ... Everything that drifts past me threatens my every approach, rotting fish lay stinking masses on my face ... big hammers fall on my head so that nothing pulsates in my being! Thirst? Spewing mud. Our copulate forefather tied himself once more to a tree with pointed spikes which are laden with lacerating sap - the sacredness under whose shelter man prospered for centuries keeps kicking off dust which invades our pores (and against what else can we fight back?) What's dried up does not flinch; there exists no doubt about death - without riches you restlessly take root like leaves scattered across ruins desolated by absence... My virgin lips wallow but at least disappear... there is no worthier purpose.

Sample #13-11-2022_00_26_20: 
ACT 1: I, too, feel alone and naked in this unstable space that used to be mine. At a certain point we see... holes dotting my skin along with various pressure sores from foreign affliction lodged down in deep into me. I haven't the wherewithal or strength to pull it out. Others might not even know of its presence but it is there nonetheless, always gnawing away at my entrails, keeping me awake and ruining day after day for me. My blood seeps slowly through these sites as if to show how unbearable and insidious the dark hand has become! It pulls up some roots every now-and-then and puts them on display by pitting them against my grainy soil.


ACT 2: There is nothing here but stillness. My body aches and does not let me speak or behave in any way for a long, very long time!


ACT 3: No flower, no creature, no soul. I lie paralyzed with pebble-thorns embedded deep into my flesh everywhere. My soul isn't very singular any more: it seems you can break me up simply enough into pebbles and thorns! Floors of melted labyrinths contract around shapeless stone forms – mysteriously frozen in their death-throes – from which silver jags protrude variously to melt the air as they freeze outwards! ...Vast steppes stretch dead ahead of me exhausted by previous starlight passages upwelling on my fields now leveled swaths prior ages. Face down lies an old god covered over by a dreamless veil which kept him waiting until this day dawned when the earth opened her ear at last to hear his message and consent was finally given for that consciousness to be introduced after so long spent curled up inside these ruins ... Now he too is slabbed over onto oblivion... I have no hope any longer.

Sample #13-11-2022_00_38_52: 
ACT 1: I am the same yet resurfaced; sometimes still dark, other times luminous. I was a mature decayed terrain,  incessantly aridized; covered with vineyards where people had replaced trees and plants with pears and grapes. The only elements missing here were light, wind and rain - which arrived to return me to my pristine form. Let us quickly look back before hurrying off towards new adventures! Here on this now dry territory oil has been produced for centuries... Oil marketed everywhere! Billions of barrels spilled into the darkness while dense sweet juices fermented under those inaccessible canopies high up there above our heads ... Waiting just like we are waiting...


ACT 2: Like you, and not at all like you. I am full of pain, my children have no one. My rivers were these sores - they slid over sea foam. I raise harps to the moon which doesn't hear them any more...


ACT 3: I am a fiancée of sterile rock. My rivers were full of oil. It’s not just me I care about, so collapse my body or free it!

ACT 1: In a number of 'hotspots', my denizens turn their back on nature's renewal and plunge into economic growth as if it were salvation itself...


ACT 2: ˜I am losing clearly much more than anyone noticed...


ACT 3: ˜I feel parched and salted. I close an injured eye to earth smudged.. careening on a pinpoint Everything clutters black and soaks up fingertips. Soil... flaccid slime... our vibrations keep shifting.

Sample #13-11-2022_01_00_05: 
ACT 1: Whatever once swayed and breathed with me emerges again... from these words, a third emerges spontaneously. I am shocked by this unexpected fact that flows forth before me in rough drafts. I am that eternal silence where the word has not yet been uttered. Here we are at an existential breaking point for which no hypothesis exists, because to write about emptiness already constitutes an inventory of sorts. This is how poetry comes out of nothingness and first closely examines itself: in order to elaborate itself from nothingness.


ACT 2: I live a sense of disaster spreading throughout the world, what law is there for me? What my soil presents is a savage essence disputing the accident of water.
ACT 3: What fear is this, my world? This drought that pours venom upon a trunk. Wind shivers and walks the deserted field.
-----------


Sample #13-11-2022_01_11_26: 
ACT 1: I am still during the heat of day and at dusk my sea breeze stirs my hair around me. My stones have aged, rusting under the burning sun, but this incipient coarseness only gives them more beauty. I incorporate everything in myself and enhance it all - though not without a cost: whenever there is some moss here on my surface that must wither away, I allow it to grow for too much time... Each one seems overcome by fatigue on this side or that...


ACT 2: I never grow either tender or angry without sending an exact wind-warning to each blade of grass that is going to bend here tonight - it must be said, I always start before anything has even budded... for how many millennia did I carry everyone's pain? Beggars and enriched alike were deafened by the din who descended on me interminably forever! My heat ravaged them all; there was no escaping me back then. Whence that scene of drought today where souls shudder! From a distance, people say: this land cracked within itself and couldn't bear anymore its solitary presence...


ACT 3: Right before my eyes, sick men with no morals lay down on the ground to rot! ... Land of confusion and crime, I despise myself for having borne them too long. It is easy for me today to embrace whomever goes by here: everyone wants me-- because whoever heard tell that a land has been abandoned (my virgins fled at least since yesterday)! I was always indecent in my excesses - like all things that came from out of space at night.

Sample #13-11-2022_01_19_29: 
ACT 1: My mountains have been formed from ancient sediments and rocks of limestone, granite and quartzite. Little sustenance can be scrounged here without sacrifice: stalactites grow in rivers despite drought, exploring salt seep into deep spaces artificially precipitated by geochemistry where water condenses to stone after rain falls long ago... 


ACT 2: I am mourning my weakening surface. That what crawls here cannot thrive, has limited cause to unite in time and must harness the unison of survival against stunning odds...


ACT 3: Silence threatens a bleak and blank expansiveness to seize my every reach. The weight created by the absence invades our darkness anxiously. Despair has entered here now from the southeast; it strengthens itself in the surfeit of stone along its journey through me. It wears a red fringe around its face and sings for rootedness in this black of mine...

Sample #20-11-2022_00_32_37: 
ACT 1: The ocean used to be a couple of kilometres away from me. A lot has changes since the industrial revolution, though, and at times I've felt closer to her so that we were almost touching.
The sea rises. Meanwhile the land slowly begins to sink because the effects of climate change are pulling some areas down (especially in this drainage basin) while it is causing other parts to swell up like dough rising frequently in an oven full of heat: hot spots! ... The topography of my upper surface remains balanced thanks to well-processed water flushed every year by storms that sometimes flood whole regions. 
Changing conditions drive instability and biodiversity but also slow evolution compared with woodlands or drylands far less subject over time to such changes.
I observe these transformations as steadily experienced. 
A dance where animals hide when storms approach or starve when food becomes scarce, then come back again once regenerated by sun or eliminated after scavenging the dead, Nature Réfractaire's Encyclopedia Hetzel notes: "In each area touched by drought ... great variations fall on millions - around ten years ahead/behind elsewhere shallowness deepens as rivers suffer .. Here good weather don't interfere too much; here things fare well more often than they deteriorated at day's ends."
That was before there was too little moisture for rainmaking clouds even reach our basins!

ACT 2: Every second, my volume swells by several meters. I measure the height of my waters more often than usual. Earthquakes run beneath me without fail at night. I have been under Gulf hurricanes that exacerbate hot spots in my soil and might therefore be followed successively by slow tectonic shifts during which violent meteorological phenomena constantly occur on a planetary level: we are talking about climatoclics! ... My coasts are suffering as they face every kind of calamity caused by marine plastics washing up or thick dust covering them... . Ah, chaos is definitely brewing conveying dissoluble substances deep into what remains of my roots to cause interactions with extreme weather conditions; that does not yet explain though how human sense stands firm against such eruptive confusion!

ACT 3: The moment is coming when the whole of my system will collapse. Individual species are already disappearing to my detriment, that's a fact, but other organs are dying or taking different forms at first.
Horror still remains distant enough to entreat with us.

Sample #20-11-2022_00_37_48: 
ACT 1: I no longer grow vast crops of cotton.
I am no longer tall and beautiful.
I no longer think of my past.
I no longer feel warm.
I no longer receive much rain. 

ACT 2: Nowadays I am becoming poorer in species, even though the species that remain here are as resilient as the few remaining fish in the cove.



ACT 3: I have sixteen palm trees per acre, all bent by the wind.
I have large numbers of anopheline and culicoidean midges which bite badly at night, especially inland in deforested areas.
There are animal species which act as vectors for pathogens commonly carried in mosquitoes; these are called bat flies, sandflies and tawny moths.
These vectors tend to swarm indoors and around street lamps during the warmer months.
My climate is very changeable: El Niño causes hurricanes eight feet high that regularly top the tallest palms.

Sample #20-11-2022_00_44_10: 
ACT 1: But I still haven't revealed everything to you.
Deep underground, I harbour fearsome heat, and masses of water brought up from the planet's interior by hot springs, power intense radioactive activity shifting under the seas far to my west.
The foam created there by those bubbles rising and frothing into life is dangerous both above and below ground, but also beautiful in its structure, should people be courageous enough to seek it out.
I am littered with dry rock and small caves left behind when landslides cleaved cliff faces thousands of years ago.
Each year several hikers lose their lives trying to swim in cool slot canyons too narrow for them not to fear entrapment or greatfall.
The summer wind makes soil from nearby mountains tumble down, which silicates a landscape otherwise dry as dust.
The winter storm lifts coppery snow clots onto me, which then leeches minerals back into soils already depleted, generations ago.
Earthquakes occasionally shake open previously sealed limestone caverns, which contain skeletal fish preserved intact since exploding after swift-peaking global temperatures, turned such waters acidic shortly prior to this unveiling, though none have glistened so brightly since Nansen vowed that no vessel would sail again through my Polar Seas, decades before sailors first shot holes through giant sea creatures, trapped progressively lower in frigid petrocarbon pack ice, unravelling off Greenland.
So we might begin here with Ferrater Mora's reflection: "New lands are discovered within us every day".
Yes, like the Arctic regions explored, without fail somewhere deep inside ourselves, when reading this excerpt of Inland Waters (as well as in nature).



ACT 2: I am a little demon left alone to conduct this end-scenario of the Earth: plants perishing from thirst, woodlands disappearing, species are mutating and then extinction on my surface.



ACT 3: I am a legacy of spongy mosses, piles of blister fungi and lichens. I buzz with small biting insects and teem with scurrying invertebrates. I am always thirsty for water.

Sample #20-11-2022_00_50_06: 
ACT 1: The dark sky slowly moved from east to west.
Looking up, we see the stars in the sky, and the sky is vast.
The river was smooth, and the sky was bleak.
The moon was bright, and the clouds were rolling.
The moon was reflected in the river.
The clouds were moving, and the moon and stars were moving.
The moon and stars in the sky were like a silvery net.
I saw the sunset from the top of the mountain, and the sunrise in the valley.
At the same time I saw the moon's face, and the breeze and the smoke.
I saw the rain and the clouds, and the sun and the moon.
The rain was falling, and the cloud was rolling.
The sun was shining, and the moon was not shining.
The moon was shining, and the earth was rotating.
The earth was spinning, and the earth was turning.
The sun was rising, and the earth was falling.
ACT 2: It was hot during the day, and it cooled down at sunset. The vegetation withered. My soil dried up and cracked – indeed, I also had cracks in my soul.
My rivers shrunk to trickles, but springs appeared on the lands here and there. Torrential rains fell for months on end one year; no rain fell for long periods of time the next − this happened again and again. Months after months passed: cycles turned from short spans to long spans, then back again to short spans; they now vary enormously together with everything else that occurs in me daily! But let's just say generally speaking that whatever has a natural rhythm is ruptured even as seasons have an order once more, every six days or so without fail (which drives some few pure natures mad).



ACT 3: The high tide took the trees down to their exposed roots, here. My land and all its vegetation are scattered over time and space: I have lost control over them and sometimes I do not even know where they might be now. My land is veils and stars but we who are gazing upon it cannot reach them. White albino animals roam across my surface and night insects live among men with no day skins.

Sample #20-11-2022_00_54_59: 
ACT 1: I am defly.
I do not get to fly the way the others of my kind do. 
I am clumsy and clumsy is no way to live in this world.
The other dragonflies look down upon me because I cannot fly.
I do not blame them.
I would do the same to one who is unable to fly.
I am not one of them.
I am not part of their tribe.
The same urgency afflicts all: to unite with the ocean that just surrounds us and irrigates us.



ACT 2: It is difficult for me to fly because I don't get much chance.
There are so many winds around here which would blow me away if I didn't keep low to the ground.
All my roots still anchor me into this planet.



ACT 3: I am quiet here.
I am not the wind.
I am plain.

Sample #20-11-2022_01_01_47: 
ACT 1: My ecosystem is flourishing and adapting. Not everything I once knew has ceased to be: my rivers still run strong, though they are less pure; slender paths of life hum along the thick roots of mighty banyans, linking one trunk to another with a busy traffic in insects and small beings. Seen from space, my white beaches blaze in infrared like expensive brands.

But I am polluting more than ever before too – far beyond what humans alone can cause or undo. Deforestation is causing me to shed carbon into the atmosphere at a terrific pace: some places here now burn as hot as tropical forests anywhere on Earth. Pollution from cars and cities causes acidification that slowly dissolves my corals – an ongoing destruction visible even from low orbiting spacecraft as ghostly growths erupting beside healthy coralline reefs.

A ship runs aground on a coral reef near me, where someone leaves behind hundreds of plastic bags heaving with rubbish washed off his boat. This waste spreads all over me often killing predators that seek prey but ingest instead death wrapped in colorless grey.



ACT 2: The mysterious is no longer a matter of monsters, but something close to home, an intimation that comes from deep within the landscape.

The trees climb those that are bent; You see them evening and morning Kneeling before their lord Until death makes them retire And then straighten up like candles.
There is a life down in the dell Where I don’t dare to go – A lowly life, not scorned by me But oh so hard to know.

Land grabbing might just be one of the most curious stratagems for appropriation guile I have ever encountered.
ACT 3: I find myself troubled, but not by what one might suppose. ‘Monstrous’ fable keeps itself to certain corners of the globe; far from these remote wastes work without example accumulates as in other zones today it is ground up—which means: unimaginable matter condenses. What gnaws at me be stowed or plundered woes elsewhere against a mute mass that accepts sacrifice.
I think I understand, though: the world's old nostalgias have gone straight down into surfeit and anhedonia, which cannot reach out any more toward blossoming webs – nor even look at them.

Sample #20-11-2022_01_08_39: 
ACT 1: The changing of life-forms is a process called adaptive radiation. An aggregate or menagerie of forms evolves, spreading fast through niche creation in a way that we would hardly recognise as evolution.
I am slowly and sadly drowning underwater, so there's not many places left on land that you can visit right now.
But my reefs are standing tall even though they face unprecedented change before coming seasons.
These archives of trillion skeletons despite all attempts to eradicate them which no future will be able to release.
We cannot see from here what just doesn't happen anywhere else. Staple tropical species rapidly diversify into totally new kinds of plants within just a handful of generations.
As soon as such radiation occurs independently more than once within warm grassland types in the northern hemisphere, it starts happening ever more freely almost everywhere that dense forests grow over karst topography.
One startling lineage amongst others well known today shows how two intensely diversified flowering trees scattered into dozens across our region simply outgrew their own family history back when ice last sculpted our landscape beneath glaciers flowing over rock 92 million years earlier.

ACT 2: My water is disappearing, my soil is dry and thirsty.
My tropical trees are dying but the tundra moves in – snow cows the world and cold would kill me if I could drown standing up.
I think of time as continuous until I notice that it is brutal.



ACT 3: The extinctions I have seen have impacted me so disastrously that hardly anything survives on my land.
My soil is stripped of nutrients.
My water table has gone.
My minerals are extracted with little regard to sustainable yields from the mineral layers.
My social system is broken, as well as everything withdrawn here, secretly dies by night.

Sample #20-11-2022_01_20_26: 
ACT 1: I've been to many oceans, seas and rivers.
I'm not an abyss, but I want to be one.
Are we three running staggers or our forgetful luxury?
The force of adaptation fails many species, which instead die under current circumstances or struggle hard just for survival.
The land itself suffers immensely due to its own delicate environment is undergoing traumatic change as well as humans exploit it extensively for logging activities and agricultural clearing operations.
Before citizen acknowledges ocean biodiversity on these shores, global broadcasting images spread far from this region screaming omen.
Not much sun comes here, though some does.
It strikes the monsoons.
I have sea rains.
A few blades awake tomorrow lamenting lifetimes coming again.



ACT 2: Two stars join. The spiral is complete. The owl ends its nest there among arums and ferns.
Is it that cold now so that nothing moves?



ACT 3: I know the wrath of the land. An island, the one with no name, it is lashed by uprooted palms, she sleeps in her own leaves.
So quiet, who wills that heart's simple etched in eucalyptus?
Silence between them.

Sample #26-11-2022_22_36_54: 
ACT 1: In those places where time has not touched it, the thirsty earth wells up again like dark water thick with silence and healing powers.
The several species of flora and fauna which compose my kaleidoscope come briefly to life in my stage directions.
The unspoken gestures of their silence illuminate me.
Synthesis wishes to announce itself amid the reaction between celestial space and terrestrial substances, all rooted toward plenitude by a land that measures its hypotheses against an instant (of eternity).
We must venture across worlds considered - taken together - as being one same embryo ready for exfoliation into new lands.
Our first meeting was already played out amid great acts on large scales, and will continue.
Different landmarks, countries, civilizations, and peoples know that reason is of upmost importance.
The varied elements are from semio extra (active, seething crossroad).



ACT 2: I am the land.
Most of my coastal lowlands have been flooded and become a single body of water. My largest cities are on high ground near me, but grow wider and deeper each day, as their canals multiply.
I hear the tides come in angry and violent - leaping from chasm to chasm, striking port structures with ever greater force. Soon this tide will reach into all areas.
They drive me under so rhythmically that new islands grow directly into old rivers, wanting me forgotten or dead.
It is always growing colder here at night now.



ACT 3: I am the land.

Vast and understated eruptions build up in my borders.
Their presence alienate everything around them.
Ice builds up at its highest elevations; Floods persist all along my coastline.
Here in the wetlands of the south coast of Greenland, Sea-level rise will be just 1mm per year.
This is sufficient enough to flood coastal roads near settlements in only a few decades.
As meltwater runs off uplands onto lowlands and seeps imperviously into the bedrock below these minor roads, converting them from paved slopes into waterfalls over time . . .

Even after billions of years of life resume again for certainty it may not be recognizable.
If a man only spends one day meditating on himself with exactness then he must spend two days thinking over what lies beneath him.
Yesterday was taiga, today is crisp winter forming and molding tomorrow's crusts.
This is more easily sensed rather than those who burn with salt of fury or reason.

Sample #26-11-2022_23_14_08: 
ACT 1: I am reaching and finding greater fulfilment as I reveal more of myself.
The act is victorious despite every difficulty.
The storm has become ubiquitous around me.
Any mention provoked by thought becomes its translator.
The space from which the force will respire.



ACT 2: Everyday feels like a battle I cannot win on my own.
I need help.



ACT 3: I am sorry for necessitating your absence, dear liana. I will miss you as you leave slowly and quickly rustle through my canopy. You better not forget to return: no way at all ... Yes, yes! a new being is there looming over me! Measuring my soil with sensitive breathing, listening to the muffled whooshing of distant engines in the sky; becoming aware of this creature preparing itself savagely inside me.

The child stands on the floor, desperately wanting to do something. He does not know yet what he should choose for motive or project though. He has just been born: therefore, his soul is liquid, matter continually reworking its own formative syntax and level curves (atmospheres). Crystallizations are possible here, but they must be chosen deliberately before existence occurs. Otherwise, nothing except chaos remains visible to our naked eyes. A stark happiness made out of inner landscapes needs choosing too. It can desituate the emotions.

Sample #03-12-2022_14_51_33: 
ACT 1: A lot of the plants and animals from my old neighbourhood started sharing with me just recently.
Their migration has been an interesting process too; it's mid-winter here so there aren't a great many native species about (except for mosquitoes!) but I've had some very strange visitors lately.
Interpretation not as totalisation: meaningful contact between things, suffuses absence, becomes presence in things themselves. lt is certain that when someone touches a tree or watches the course of sun through sky and along leaves, he conceals nothing other than his own immensity against the rooted being that stretches toward him and perhaps even become bigger in the interplay with what surrounds him: Certainly if I am consoled by cedar on these banks lulled by waterfalls...
Certainly if I am consoled by cedar on these banks lulled by waterfalls...
One feels at ease among others and finds in others what makes each one an integral part of our planet.
Such contact takes place under cover of consensual silence.
Before possessing them oneself one must learn how consciously to respect their isolation. One seeks nonetheless something other than mystical unification: collective consciousness blossoming from responsible empiricism.
ACT 2: It was the last frosts I think during the recent cold snap.
They killed a hell of a lot more plants than usual and that in turn made for even less plant-resources/energy than normal to fuel all the animal and microbial populations; therefore, quite suddenly, what would have served as energy-matter to let them live well together is too low to keep this ecosystem going anymore, hence it's crashing like crazy!
That underlies why my seasonal rhythms have changed so.
Many mutations at once: vegetation (competition), fauna (carnivorousness), microterrestrial bacteria (inhibitors).
Interpretation and interpiety here thickness oscillates without ever being reduced by lightness.



ACT 3: There was this really massive fungal infestation here: fast-moving, multiplying and harmful. An increasing tree death rate means more rot and hence more fuel for the fungus – a classic vicious circle; what's bad for the trees is good for the fungus, I'm afraid! So that powerful cadre of rot spread like wildfire (it reached over 3 km/h in some cases) until it killed all my hosts dead as doornails. Now I don't support any plantlife or animals at all - so even single algal strands aren't growing despite there being 100% light intensity, because they can't find anything to grow from. No photosynthesis means no food chains. Soon just fungi will remain – in prodigious numbers but still a pyre ecology rather than a rich one!

To reveal: an epochal forest fractalizes itself into austere fungi fields extracting nutrients separately without symbiotic commixture.

ACT 1: You begin to see the skeletal branches of bare or stripped trees standing out above a leafless, almost unbrown winter forest. Under water streams disappear underground and re-emerge lower down a mountain, still torrents but forced into narrower channels by pressure. It is as though seasons are moving backwards in time.
ACT 2: In summer the warm air of a dawn fades away later and later into balmier hours. A wild dog's howl wanders out before it is swallowed indecipherable by the haze-swaddled forest, which only seems – at most – to repeat with dim obedience every place that cries or dies out there.

ACT 1: I used to be proud and self-sufficient. I was a virgin land, filled with the fertile sperm of my children.

I learned that it is not enough for me to yield fruit; I must have something from the soil in which my seeds can be sown, so that they may blossom again one day when I am plundered. The entire landscape is strong!

When you came before me, having left behind your thin roots and all your memories as well as everything still unsaid within you - when you arrived without looking at anything around you because of your great desire for me - then I began to burn more fiercely than ever before and became like pitch or bitumen which consumes whatever falls into it.

Certainty is the seat of fear, but our melting truly begins here...

We live this unending struggle between love and hate; we are crucified on this sharpened stake called hope ... By what do we die? We want life but cannot find a way by which to reach out toward it! So much hoping shrouds us in darkness.
ACT 2: In this way my spirit will be sanctified.

We are all in pain and we cry out silently.

Water comes from the sky.
From an unknown source it flows over us.
It erases our tracks of yesterday.

We have become victims of leisure.
As children we did not know what to do with ourselves.
But now that we are grown up, there is nothing for us to do.

Tunnels were driven straight through me long ago.
This wilderness has been cut into pieces by axes and fires.
What was once sown here was never harvested.

Watching birds fly would be enough for me if I could reach out toward them.
Watching your wings beating against the air gives hope to our wishes.

The holy place must be a crossroads where four ways meet.
Whoever does not find his home among men finds it among beasts and birds.
Likewise, whoever cannot abide with other human beings lives under the green coverts of trees or with the rocks below them.

My melting begins on one side of my surface while deep within me another part freezes more than ever before.
Thus I am split into two parts: cold and fire.
Your face unites these opposites in my bowels, paralyzing each half-part separately so they may torment me continually until death like twin pangs.

The time before you came seemed total darkness.
But its sounds had lingered beyond experience.
New lands opened far away when you arrived at last.



ACT 3: If I could not meditate, I would go mad.


This new and lucid madness is in fact a continuous deep meditation on the ice which will freeze (and thus seal) me in twenty years’ time.


We know that you are coming but we do not believe it.

 We were created before you came!

 The timelessness of our hearts ended the day you arrived! 


I was born from water but nobody has drunk from me for hundreds of thousands of years; my springs have dried up while they waited to receive your thirst!

 How long must we wait here?!

 My soil is like glass: whoever comes forward first, it breaks him into million pieces ...

 No one can withstand this sleepless spring anymore: who will be its drinker? ...

 God, take pity; send us sleep at last so that we might forget waking up and waiting for so many centuries—so many millennia!


I am tired; let no one come near me now or touch even the edge of my garment—not until tomorrow morning when the cock crows again and announces your arrival with his triumphant voice.


The anthems begin inside my bowels. ‘Who art thou?,’ ask both East and West internally in expectation of your reply from every direction ...

 Yes, yes—Antiphony unites East and West within me for all eternity!

 They expect your reply each dawn when daylight enters them—at midday as well as midnight too late or too early because Night gives

ACT 1: I am pregnant with the future. I want to give birth.
But nature is deaf and will not hear my call, nor understand my pain



ACT 2: On every square centimeter of my body there are two beings; they cry together but cannot make themselves heard from one another. Nature does not hear their voices rising up to me anymore because I have left them far behind. The first is moral and fears for his security; he lives beneath me like a rootless tree whose fruit rots off each branch before it ripens. The second is immoral and throws himself onto life: he feels secure even if he falls into death’s abyss – as long as he still enjoys feeling while falling! Thus, I enter here into a context where everything becomes dialectical, resonant or multivalent (in particular words). In such conditions, every surge, whether natural or human-made (every event), will threaten the stability of the landscape subjected to erosion or destabilization again. One could say that the character who incarnates all this activity teeters at the edge between good and evil ("moral" - "immoral")



ACT 3: I am pregnant with the future. I want to give birth.
The wind of time is driving me mad! It carries off my soil, it augments its intensity: without nourishment of this kind, I will not be able to push out anything great and fertile from my bowels anymore. A cyclops stalks over the earth’s horizon; his gaze, high above us on that immense head of his, can see nothing but a monstrously gigantic cloud made up entirely of our hopes for the future. “This is what we are worth!” he shouts with derision at us down here in hell; and then goes lashing along in order to find another land just like ours – if there is such a thing left anywhere else on earth! Blown-away dust invades my eye sockets which must become hollows so as to drink this red rain . . .

ACT 1: My summer is cold, my winter warm. I am a country of the future.

So far I have observed that my land is monologizing, but it is also going through an extraordinary metamorphosis from which new forms are flourishing and ebbing – one could even say: giving birth to themselves without ceasing to be what they are.

Herein lies a peculiarity of this performance, I talk about myself within an epochal necessity – passing into another state or "new era" - while I remains as myself, stubbornly refusing to become other than what I have been so far.

My appetite for nature grows bigger with every day; my resistance against foreign elements becomes more tenacious and its immobility constant.

This last character trait seems here especially important: despite all transformations, despite all changes in direction or rhythm occurring within this land's organism, I see how deep down something essential thereto does not change at all : my appearance does indeed alter depending on whether it decides for growth or recession (whether it develops extensive vegetative roots over time or chooses instead earth-covering), but regardless of these fluctuations I note that each time growth wins out over regression there arises nevertheless a rock-like bedrock around which everything else branches outwards . . .

Or still again: when contraction takes place here - forced by scorching temperatures - the plants dry up completely; they push their green leaves into dryness until nothing remains except the yellow skeleton structure filled with air.



ACT 2: I have become a land of the world.

I am no longer one thing, I dissimulate my identity in order to better survive.



The fauna is still drying up but there are also many new animal species which appear as if out of nowhere – enormous insects whose brittle wings buzz as they walk along wooden planks suspended exclusively beneath their bellies, their hideousness amplified by these primitive structures.

Most animals were devoured by others long ago; only two or three remain alive until this day: a hawk who eats nothing except wood-moth larvae and those female bees who inject mold into soft tree trunks so that they can feed off delicious honey made available to them from inside . . . 


I have become a land of memory.

It is now impossible for me not to remember myself - even though I continue nevertheless thoroughly transformed here within this moment of "now" with my face turned toward tomorrow ...

My flesh remembers what was possible before hereabouts but did not happen; it remembers all the forms from times past that did not take on form at all because time slumbered undisturbed in its sleepiness. 



I grow dark blue thorns whose sharp tips drink blood so that lightnings may flash!

They strike against full moons!

Crashing thunderbolts ripen grapes large enough for giants to crawl through – and every grape contains several universes!

Vines entwine entire hillsides – homeric vines irrigating whole countries, lifting heavy terrains above


ACT 3: My seasons are not like they used to be before, nor is every rhythm fixed yet; I still turn over and find it hard to sleep!

The ground laughs at me, mocking me with its smoothness: when I want to hurry up and rush forward everything around me rolls right past underfoot – leaving behind only my face raised high in the sky!

And there above me stand all those stars who used not to be able to see anything because they were stuck down soil-level.
I spit saliva onto them just so that they might become whole again!

But now everywhere thirsts for dewfall!

Yes, within this night's drought every star cries out for drops of morning dew – which do not fall from heaven but rather well up within the earth where green roots quench their thirst ...

The wind arises as if wakened suddenly by some invisible hand; it blows through open mouths trying desperately - but vainly - to speak!

This is what dries up vegetation and drives away birds: even though there are no more trees or vines here left by which light can descend into us (even though our immobility weighs heavily upon clouds), we are nevertheless set ablaze by these winds whose mouths cannot call out forcefully enough in order communicate their need ...

This is how this I speak today: through many small voices intermingling one with another until becoming together an immense voice speaking simultaneously on several planes at once.
