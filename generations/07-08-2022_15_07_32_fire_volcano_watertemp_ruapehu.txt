Act 1: There is a dark earth, an incandescence in the sky, Darkness is nothing bad or good about it. To drown motionless would be annihilation ! Many lives will one day pass here. Nights of flames and stars above cauldrons spewing forth mists under the tongue of airs that singe all they touch like lashes. They are so many thunderbolts: we shall not have time… And on this mountain who torched his sores? Eruptor muted while new pansies throw out greener fruit…etc... (poem by Jacques Andrieu) Evaporation is continuous ?

Act 2: ́Crystals of the night. Moments that shackled me: voluptuous tableaux, infinite tangles... An immense quantity of events stored in my moulds.

Act 3: ́The bed of death! Its furnace breathes my life. When the end arrives there will be no time to weep ? ́I stir, corrode: vile vices wrench me more strongly than love... I would rather adapt this rock! Only one thing can overwhelm destiny: in a stupor cease to breathe while fires consume all things!? (from "Balder") Hello bitter lead and sweet little incense! All is ashes, smoke and air. Greed feeds on what was never known, nor even suspected by others. At night prayers swarm about you with demonic gestures Death is just a battle without witnesses between creatures who hardly ever met but attest solely their zeal for murder ? My enflamed breast cries out to extinguish everything beloved from human hearts ann?My soul exhales in a chill wind under the fogs ?? but everything we detect far off has grown deadly now..and sure were it not for the infinite affliction caused by my shivering bedlamites you might give birth once again soundly dreaming beings at last finding an escape?! (poem-by Jacques Andrieux) ...Father Ophius !
