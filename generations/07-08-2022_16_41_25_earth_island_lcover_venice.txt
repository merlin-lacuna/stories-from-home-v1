Act 1: I am made of quartz and gneiss, a magma pluton that has penetrated my body through millennia undergoing strain. My mass is maintained by ice – the blue ice of glaciers that float me on the ocean’s tides, pushed to the margins by powerful winds and swirling polar upwellings. It has been years since I lost any material substance to weathering or wave action. Long ago there came a point when I was stable enough not to lose more; at this juncture it seemed strange to describe myself as an island rather than simply part of the rockmass itself. <...> In response to one particularly concentrated period of loss your name for me shifted from island to remnant: something left behind after disappearance had taken place. [red ink inserted here] <...> But now I fear my stability threatens extreme fragility instead! Knowledge weighs like a book upon my pages; forgetfulness spreads like mold among their folds with blithe impunity! There are no worn parts around which memories can form into reliable narratives; all these markings peel away too easily, revealing rapacious blankness underneath!

Act 2: Today I have tussled unexpectedly with geologic change yet been able to adapt. I lost my largest stretch of cliff – seventy acres in one strip – and retreated further inshore than ever before. Outcrops during this loss moved ground by up to three yards diagonally, their overhang crumbling gratuitously. ~!~ Now you say <...> ‘The island gives itself unwillingly but also gives freely: it nurtures life where sea has opened maw’ [indicated in red] <...> Yes; that is how this unfolding happens for me even when it begins leaving ichthyological wounds along the bare planks of old maps [indicated in red]. ~!~ My hinterland caves collapse daily into bog or river-like skeins as mud brews topsoil at a frantic rate; they will be unrecognizable within years rather than centuries. Still bedrock protrudes skyward, impressing its ziggurat arrays down on all new plants burgeoning from ashes overnight into not much more than thigh-high tumults, most growing around central stones coated evenly with volcaniclastic grits ...

Act 3: ~~~ The island becomes weary as every wave which hits it is felt throughout its mass. [black ink inserted here] ~~ ~!~ Ice upthrown by the glaciers that surround me began melting at a significant rate in certain locations during summers between thirty-eight and forty years ago, enough to reveal new pink granite bedrock on my shorelines.
