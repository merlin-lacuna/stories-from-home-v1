Act 1: I'm overwhelmed by anguish. It fills me with such weight, heaviness and power that it moves within my body like liquid metal or lava. ? I tremble for the planet's sake - mine is much less threatened! - because I have seen Nature pollute herself irreparably with man and his industries. Because there is no longer anywhere else to flee ... any other 'island' will be just as withered since our species depends on the entire cosmos, fortunately ... otherwise there would be hardly a single living thing left on Earth!?

Act 2: ___________________ I AM SO ANXIOUS!! _____________________? What you call the Hell of Existence Brings Surprise Happiness And that happiness can be called by a child's name. ____________________ The phoenix involves its despair In regaining itself, in every Nest. _________ Where we see great darkness Is really everywhere light Who seems to count us doesn't! _________________________ Oh weakness of things that surround me So long as within them resides The longing for life Of an incredible not-knowing ... ______________ He who felt himself fragile ? Forgives all damage he sees now: Elseland can bear it, my heart too knows this ......... ??? You behold me still caught up Within the cosmic conflict ?? between what is gentle and base That claps like the hammer on metal ...... My defenseless condition intimidates me where I stand here with lifted hands before fate ....... Thankless task deserving at most Negation Distant from praise, totally Ordained toward deprivation....... Though gladly measured against nothingness.... Because however much wisdom there exists yet In knowing beings and knowledge ........ This Earth received warmth toward becoming ..... Darkness already bears untouchable beauty .......... And innocence arrived close carefully From sharp questioning eyes...... .

Act 3: ______________ How many times it has changed inside of me! ...How many days, how much actuality That I only attained through knowing ...... ____________ Once in the past ... when fire and thoughts came alive The large chest moved.... .......... under mastery, within ....... Flowers that feel not with human hands: True ripeness always within .. ...... Ripe body...... ........ _________________ Becoming mature is now late for me ......... but that was Being Suddenly happened to me. .............. Then wide youth filled my arms ...................... until finding totally spent sensibilities............... Mine achieving fullness......... ? But all those hours were still loaded With a surplus of vital energy - from love? Between greeting and leaving In progress dwelt deep rhythms................ And they exalt themselves into death To their core without intent or purpose: ...... They grow and are satisfied to be prodigal Because by nature they exist? so simply......... thay do not contrive. (Gravely Spring calls up something too true - My ears ring with happiness just now.) Lasting ripe half-things encouraged us actually To concentrate on going toward heaven itself!!! Yes, then fulfillment called out........................ Hold whatever can't be said against the strange Unnameable sound which rings almost like silence.. .
