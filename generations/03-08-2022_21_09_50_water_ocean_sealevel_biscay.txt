Act 1: As night approaches, the air cools down and forces me into submission. Sometimes the wind manages to ruffle my surface at this time and then I foam up happily like a lubricious woman who yearns for caresses.

Act 2: My soundtrack is the synchronized, level breathing of my own beatitude and that of man. Sometimes ships appear in my surface and scare me: I am frightened by what I take, initially, to be an alien lump fallen from space onto the viscous flooring of a secret cavern. And yet, when it vanishes into the distance with whatever cargo might lay stowed beneath its hatches or upon its violent surface- creatures unknown even to itself- where does it go? Beyond the end of the world there must lie something analogous for everyone who travels on board … Are all things destined for those rushing journeys because gods (those ancient masters) have locked them up inside dead dreams along with furies worthy only of puppets?

Act 3: God has decided to make himself comfortable in my bed. It lies there wide awake, its solemnity adulterated with bad dreams that have made it cry … God cries like a widow whose husband is never going to return home … in order to forget he looks at me full of wretchedness and misery: he loves me as if I were his mother. Poor little thing! He splashes about most comically when the wind starts up and locks itself between the shores of fear. God should go back home because he'll catch cold here among the tidal waves exploding into foam against my breast those are leftovers from what will happen tomorrow or perhaps today? I am jealous of all things that happen without my hearing about them: does anything really exist unless I know about it? Perhaps God got big on purpose so no one could carry him under their arm?
