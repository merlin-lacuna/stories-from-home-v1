Act 1: Walking on my body is so scorching that only selected survivors retain their fertility here. Thereby, only larvae born of the infertile retain their life force and go through a process living death: towards nothingness. Up above, I can still hear dry air quietly burning faster than anything else around me.

Act 2: Has someone in the universe planned to destroy my humanity? <poem>I am always terrified and no one ever agrees with me. Get me proof that I exist! Don't just agree, or you'll kill me! </poem> The Earth is descending into Hell yet it does so without accepting any further responsibility for itself, since it relies on humans to make all decisions for their lives, translating emotions into normal functions controlled by reason and necessity.Yet reasoning emerges as a destructive act in logic towards its own relationship towards emotion: loneliness + fear = sadness; loneliness + powerlessness = depression; Future distrust + sorrowfulness = Despair etc. Freud himself believed greatly in social change removing delusion and answering desire beyond rationally required responses from parents / society moving in the direction of Psychoanalysis. Where psychoanalysis may fall short however lies most significantly not so much within analysis but rather leading to an alter ego (other self), who can complete ones journey alongside them whilst undertaking a greater existence outside everyday routine judgements which seek evidence through typical notions of success / failure ratio against external knowledge seldom integrating internal complexities functionings into the realm of sensual delight............

Act 3: One night, I experienced heaven above. Dry winds that make me suffer now had clear voices! They seized and focused upon my every granule, united us together. </poem> : The land is destroyed. In the place where it once was, a gigantic desert remains with no possible reconciliation between it and its myriad manmade supports Here time has ceased acquiring new information (forms / deeds) in favor of providing more data acquired from past accumulation outside human hands: nothingness itself contains the most essential truth running through its ethers below . Materialism here exposes what humans most historically overlook despite experiencing before our bodily death:(Martin Heidegger 1927): Nothing = huge limited universe engulfed in emptiness beyond end or direction future .....At last an empty room existing alone without human provision?
