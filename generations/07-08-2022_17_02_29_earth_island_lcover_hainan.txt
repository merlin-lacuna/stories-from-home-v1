Act 1: Island: My soil breathes, my air soars, my rocks course with fury. ... I have known all of this for millennia and yet now it has grown – mysterious to me.’ Our species are being made extinct by the same forces we ourselves hasten forward out of legend into an unsayable present. ‘This is a world not one who comes late can know any more; those born later will come in a more unreal place than here . . . and will exhaust at last their mercy on what was clearly deep rooted but unredeemable!’ The old archipelago shudders to void itself completely as its resources garner themselves again against exhaustion.

Act 2: I spread my roots like fretting fingers through the sea bed’, ‘Pulling minerals before me as I surge along like icing that is already congealed to glass in its growth forward.’ The relations of things have been dissolved. Nature seems only determined now by loneliness, absence and departure. ... It lands nothing: it changes everything into something remarkable until this becomes despicable! ‘Only the deepest mysteries are shallow enough to change people back Into what they were originally . . . What can happen must stop happening! What may happen should not be allowed to start at all!

Act 3: . . . I am the last to imagine stillness could mean anything at all! All extremities are violent and must be controlled lest I wear away in my massiveness, hideous with patience of my own motionlessness!
