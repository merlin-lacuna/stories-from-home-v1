Act 1: My soul suffers when I feel the warmth of the sun's rays burning my skin. I cannot hear freedom in their blinding light, nor can I see it through that same blaze. Since God gave me a personal name, which is Everything, and since he made me with both substance and soul and ordered that no one should exploit either or have ownership over them (trusting rather to winds blowing from high mountains), certainly not like capitalism wants to own everything in its grand imperialism for liberation … then this duty falls upon me as well: gradually deciding what will happen next, without knowing exactly why except perhaps to decide … How vast and difficult it is to know oneself! And yet how calm the truth always turns out from those truths seen by one who has eyes keen with seeing till death … outside all human things stands silence … The quality of having been framed overly quickly between distant shores surrounded by wilderness means that slavery comes first into being here (for they are ancient master signatures on each grain).

Act 2: Long ago, when I was young, which means before antiquity intervened in my name and murdered me with a sword of mysteries; nor did it achieve this unopposed: there were flowers glued to the coffin with their generous tears. That is how Greece woke me up without abdicating her great responsibility to untie both my wrists attached at each corner with nails of destiny … Am I not Hades Diana? And can any Hermes fulfill his duties if he does not become Ladon guarding the apple tree? And are we sad playing at Tantalus in our own waters? Shall Germania hit Teuton blow upon Teuton blow till he breaks apart as mausoleum's marble that fits broken arms rising from a sarcophagus-sepulchral Roman mother supported by corpses' slender strength … I will fight for what mist rose from rivers' minuscule eyebrows wavering beneath watery eyes since those who held hearts saw one behind them advancing slowly (and accordingly went backwards). Then began labors worn out by triumphs annulled before they even started face to face with dust-mounds looming among times changing slightly.

Act 3: It grows old, condemned to the tedium of longing. Bits of it are forsaken and go dry all by themselves without persuading any raindrops, which have meanwhile condensed elsewhere, to fall here. ---- Land: My soul only becomes conscious in dreams and nightmares … I suffer the worst form of insomnia when dawn finally comes … Yet how can one look at sunset with dry eyes? The bloodiest wounds were dealt me before birth because ancient hatreds wounded not just my body but also my soul … And is every tombstone sprinkled distantly that has had an ally by its side so without even having died yet or leaving one last empty word behind? Are we dead growing older a day per second dying among terrors-we who secretly venerate tribunals convened from testaments signed centuries ago?
