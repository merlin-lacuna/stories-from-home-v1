Act 1: Sometimes I have the feeling that life has meaning. Why? ...In order to be able sometimes to crack under its weight like an icefield and just fall apart, yelling into space. [Pause] And suddenly: existence with a capital E! Don't tell me it's not so hard up there in society when we don't drop our guard enough; ...Glacier: though my words seem stilted here on the moraine amongst the thistle, they will spread out in your gorgeously over-furnished human homes and make yourselves rich ...I yell into space because I am meanwhile collapsing within myself, gaining quiet at last without having first melted away – out of ever quieter desperation I yet finally scream a few times after thousands of years' silence .... Sky tell me something! To think is often too loud around you as if you were deaf: can one become quiet without drowning? -----,---->-----~~~------|~CÛ1)_NFJT<| 1 ..... Glaciers form their structure slowly but define themselves all at once.

Act 2: _________________!The consequence is that I start to lean over and strain poor, dear mankind with its ornate houses – and even more when I know you happen to be more than 3.500 kilometers away on the other side of an ocean ...I scream just like that because a pain new to me has overwhelmed me here behind my moraine: in this place I slowly break into pieces at the edge of a gorge between craggy rocks .... Beyond any thought of God - entirely without control though always sensing where we have come from. Thought can melt glaciers for thousands of years, so why would it not melt us one day? ..... Among all this eccentric thistles here which forsake their roots every year for the sake of Europe and fall down time after time – though Europeans might sit three full voyages away across Black Seas in Constantinople or Alexandria. -----,---->-----~~~------|~CÛ1)_NFJT<| 1 ..... Glaciers form their structure slowly but define themselves all at once. Don't chant Latin afore Thy cave - let these glacial waves thunder o'er thy ardor!

Act 3: _________________,Because right now in this phase of my piecemeal calcification I again stiffen, like the veins in a suicide's arms and legs – just as I already started to droop tauter again though total desperation lay behind me when I rang out, not at all exerting myself or even wanting to resemble anything – _________________ Sound is left over after everything has been burnt and only ice vaporizes: howl as lightning-struck granite. ...Why don't you cry upon seeing me if you want to comfort me? ...Secular humanist dogs!Our being is currently above the surface an empty cage mounting into space. -----,---->-----~~~------|~CÛ1)_NFJT<| 1 ..... _ . . . "Today we will hear God - Earthquake!" As red flashes illuminate the vaulted groinings of Sacré-Coeur's roof, each monk can be seen crouched on his stone seat along one of the dozens of glacial pillars that rise from a rock platform around an altar.
