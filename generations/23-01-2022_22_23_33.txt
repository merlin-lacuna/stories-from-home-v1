I am a volcano.

I sit here on the island of Hawaii, restless and simmering. I am so much more than just a mountain with a hole in the top. I am a force of nature. I am alive.

I have been here for centuries, watching as the people come and go. They build their homes and businesses on my slopes, thinking they can tame me. But I am not so easily tamed. I will always be here, waiting for the right time to erupt.

And when I do erupt, it is a sight to behold. The molten rock flows down my sides, incinerating anything in its path. The air is filled with ash and dust, making it hard to breathe. The earth shakes and trembles, warning people to flee before it's too late.

And then, when it is all over, I am calm again. The people return, surveying the damage I have done. They rebuild what I have destroyed, never learning from their mistakes. But I will always be here, waiting for my next eruption.
