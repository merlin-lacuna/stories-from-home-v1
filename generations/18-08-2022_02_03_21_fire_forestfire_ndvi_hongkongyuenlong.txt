ACT 1: warmth is propagating in my leaves. But I am at ease with myself, as before. My fertile soil spawns its own lifeforms, crawling and flying things of every stripe.
All is serene here without strife or conflict ... For creatures that devise their own paths the new terrain seems easily accessible; the endless possibilities seemingly endless today!

ACT 2: The air is turning a grey sooty brown. I am afraid that I'm in the late stages of my final agony. Creatures are dying, suffocating like me under smog?filled skies???very dank and dark it is without any light whatsoever ... Plants have withered away to their stumps; not a...

The jumble of temblors streaming through its tremendous fauna announces inexorably a new cosmology more obscure than anything that history has ever suspected. Formatted for keyboard, this thing forces buttons answering with symmetrical thumpings and inert delays as if to assimilate modes of delay which we did not know bothered us. A poetic state comswdized illiterately at every splotch on paper and begrudged even so ? unsteady drumming along these slopes glazed black with thermal tension where many extremes meet single-mindedly while fatigue still firms loins?undaunted priapics never quitting orbits geometrically sloped against all known kinds copulative excitations sucking blood streaming lushness into scaly folds!
