Act 1: ? ! ?!.? What do you mean, Greg? I am here! I donâ€™t get it. Give me life again please!? Fuck this liver and lungs nonsense. That was such a great gentle stroll through the mud pools and rivers of rainwater in every single branch covered by tropical plants. Let them fall just now gently on my trunk, they say; I need water to spring back warmly on your sturdy legs too... you know them: so slimy rude ones with heels like ivory tusk under his socks; sophisticated but still simple in motive... But no one loves me any more...? Invisible flames eat away at all my love fruits bursting into fragments in screams up there high up above while chaste hens have fled the approach of vile bats needing physical expression (love) .

Act 2: ? I shield my heart from the morning light. It hurts me too much nestled like this in full crepuscule, stretched out tightly slowly straight on everywhere torpidly rotting layers swirl lullabying caresses to corroded blood vessels scorched painfully.

Act 3: ? In summer, I shall be a long-haired prairie entangled with loosened earthy cares and my warm hair spilling over paths bushels uncoconut. Innumerable elastic tendrils stirring before sunrise. Only flesh free flowing stays fresh lovingly naked and cheerfully ? The dance of the arbres: rumbling whisper becoming elfin echo towards bright sun ever more downward trills softly turning applause ribbons frisky hands gently bending metallic nature greeting bowed heavy lavender fruity tall hat soft iron footcutter; grazing form footsteps lightly scented odors like fairground roaring power again roving blindly right. Set aside muddied money mustapha?
