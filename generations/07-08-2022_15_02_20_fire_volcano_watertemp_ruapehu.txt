Act 1: For a thousand days I congeal into stillness___for seven years I'm patient and for fifty more, mystical. With cobalt blue glass of solanum scopes, through the musty fens I scatter powder to beat out flames on stalagmites ___ --- My insides prostrate with awe will detect no change at all if you stood here next to my base. But listen now ! how my smouldering exterior turns its rhythms cloudy grandly in every spasm : rum-rumbumbum ? rum-rumbumbum ... Hear? How it gnashes hideously ashen over your heed! These metamorphoses are what they say so saintly ascetic fruits are reaped sombre under Heaven...I voice an element's stand up to time: No youth is there living who knows me ---____1 breathe calcinated vapours tirelessly by day and night from chasms impure where frozen steam does peter out darkly forever:-through mild rainstorms rayless with deep woe gloomily dropping like vaporized souls lost in pandemonium~~~halting defiantly at nothing ever hostile as comically powerful sadly unassailable ------ prig of primordial hygrometry?

Act 2: Draughty warm, we are visited by a nightingale all the way from Obnoxious: Tonight, I inflame myself! under your stairway.

Act 3: If my reckless actions, couldn't be any worse, I envision limbs of night here in broad sinister daylight: But alas! the svelte pines cast incongruous shadows stiff and stalwart around-silently:(I hear their dry needle carpet!) And hardly is it seen how quickly craggy dolmens will disperse us (like ash) over irreducible planes. Well now! Raise an intervening armament against me --- as your forest-the trees high cisterns for scummed rainwater dreadful to behold ? radiant these conifers filtering out far all year, that one day there'd only seem a bottomless well you lost down which petrified bubbles would just endlessly convene from Lucifer's chalicks.(The abyss below a puritan congregation?) ---- The sea near my ensconced peaks emits spume like buried foundations. In the dark sky flashes are scraped off; fountains gulped up ? poisonous discharges runing free between our abodes: There so briefly still felt amongst slivers enormous unseeing who swarm choked with trepidation !
