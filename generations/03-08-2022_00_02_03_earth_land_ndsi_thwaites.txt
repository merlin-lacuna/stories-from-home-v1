Act 1: --- I have one main stream, but also tributaries that run off into the land back of me. *** Cliff ice cliffs and mountain mounds, peaks gleaming at their summits as reflecting where light gathers. **** Mesa, a ridge between two valleys with ice flowing in separate channels down both * A narrow crevasse cut by snow-melt running from mid slope through rock to ground *** Snow cornices shear over calving faces. . . . . . Great height nothing beyond sky stillness mountains stretching on forever *** Nothing not moving except small cloud formations unmoving they move above or ahead of me near enough maybe to touch my face white feathers hardly shifting sighs like breathing tipping constantly ..... Ground good mostly firm varying sometimes satin smooth other times cracking under impacts small cakes breaking apart and laying shimmering dust which glitters encouragingly up to hind foot tip. ---- Our base is beneath an inland glacier tongue called Disengania South East Peak; its ice cannons violently out black water onto our shoreline each summer leading us always worried about ripping open thirsty mouths thirstier holes .... Enormous volume: rapids cascading into rifts.

Act 2: -. ~ ... -:o –:::: ~ ...- Like a certain music that is near the fluid matrix of both inner and outer life . . . . State of heightened awareness, my mind disperses across avalanches unnoticeable until they fall from up high. *** My upper tributary flanks have steeply pitched underhanging icefaces 100 plus degrees in tilt because this isn't something climate has warmed or tilted yet/ ........ Cutlines scores deep into living rock show where hot white plates slid over ground to feed me instead .... Ground feels like more glacier than it did years ago; with sheets rippling constantly not just on frozen days underfoot softening too when I walk so if any land substrata shift rocks must be shifting inside their crack lines all also moving less visibly ........ Field studies indicate that sea level rise has caused water levels to rise almost 30 feet already around our tidal front enough for seawater subterraneously to enter enclaves bringing springs above unseal ed spillways to gush flooding new inland lakes ......

Act 3: ~~ and each cramp, piercing telling as I miss my old ice load ... ~,, /!” Go deeper till we are almost under water ------- and get stuck fast here in rilling stream scale of Thule ..... -­~ Constant hearings rising slowly; crackling subatomic particle fizz like fury scuttles needle-sharpness through heightening hum ..... ------------- Two tunnel downwards sculptures made into ice peaks converging to meet deep upper mouthed vertical shaft .... .......... Toxic air slightly tinged with salt must be breathed at last ........ This is what it will be like when the Final Sleep comes ................. Young ice disappearing into meltwater lakes that drink while they rise .............. One fog belt often lays over me flattening seeing low.' How a cloud can throb soundlessly cast against tinting ......... ---- Binaural beats set our highland humming --------- for weeks on end seismic silence traveling beneath us mutely ------ Wind driven ultra sonic molecular drive increasing at risk levels. .................. Chunks shift individually bearing down from above topple toppling veins sieve smaller flows moving too often surging breaths .......... No more white . . . blacker than starless dark these moods how much colder so quick before ............... Increase light swallowing variations.
