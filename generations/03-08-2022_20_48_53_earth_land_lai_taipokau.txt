Act 1: When I was young, my leaves were few and thin. Now they cover all the areas of me that face directly onto the sky – and those are many. My leaves have grown so thickly, in fact, that hardly a leafless spot remains on any side facing north or east, where sunlight is scarce here at either shoulder. ------ As time passed however ... [it] seemed to spend itself fully on my east-facing frontage only, as if renewing one winter green season per year there alone; leaving its thinnest icing on winters after winters along my southward flank instead. This flaking off became so marked (early April being still among its earliest flakes) by some fourth or fifth winter onwards that around this time of one's lifetime or next it began also clearly noticing into dozens of distinct trees: establishing what you might call leaf divisions within this larger forest ...

Act 2: ...the sum of these individual leaf trees, in their hundreds and thousands come again to seeming one forest by late autumn; so that the youthful forest which gradually mounts fast on a riverbank far below appears also mine also at last. As individuation is not only ours but integral ... ================================================================ The act ends here: ---- What has happened? ...I have never known until now how I became ill – being such a healthy tree, you see! (It may be thought that revelations such as these are only too well worth knowing.) How could I ever have supposed I had fallen under some curse or spell? Or worse! All this pain comes out of me due to spirits? Worse still: spiritual powers put me to silent pity with their poisonous enchantments?! Who knew!? This must mean the dreamer does get feverish after all – yes, though fever betrays nothing about him. If he ‘feels’ it can be judged genuine . . . Yay!! Fever likewise meshes into eccentric diviners’ rituals faithfully transmitted from past lives via vessels from tubs to gloves. .... .. . .

Act 3: ------------ The many layered texture of my soil also shifts to invite it: enabling the tree-roots there to sink deeply into strata even half a metre below ground; and conversely, making it easier for rainwater to seep down, too. ...It all goes better in truth upon each fresh, wealthier season therefore – far better than near seasons that precede none! ...For so long I lived without giving much thought at all (so little) to how increasingly common the illnesses we live with are now becoming. Years of believing them comparatively trivial or isolated incidents have effectively depleted any prior knowhow concerning their workings . . .
