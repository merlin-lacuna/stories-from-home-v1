Act 1: ... Then, as if they were spores sprayed from the sky in a spring breeze, great numbers of native and exotic plants appeared. Plant by plant I watched a soil matrix mature over me; so it was that mosses began to spread through my humus-rich matrices and kept cool the leafy tops of three ancient cycad species which dominated my eastward apex. ---- Soon thereafter knots of tree ferns poked up to nodding height where water flow slowed at dark coves between fallen trunk bundles. Many different kinds of cauli growth subsequently appeared among my rot – 'whiskets', fresh green leaves unfurling high above our heads like families reunited after arduous journeys with infants in tow ... All our fertile diversity added richness the more we evoked echoes2 one for another here – those mirrors-for once unreflecting us: solipsism banished from our small plantations . . . __ ... Meanwhile radioactivity locked into dolomite rock near reloaded itself towards implosion: because there is also lighting strike electricity trapped relatively deep therein but recombinant under pressure when release comes again.

Act 2: . . . Fat snakes hissed along our leaf-matted paths: while hooting owls soared among those same leaves, moths flew up in the tangles where tropical pitcher plants caught large flying insects – unceasing migrant circulation throughout my forest body. Replicative buzzing swarms also traversed us quite healthily, flickering as if projected into our space from plasma levels just beyond consensual reality's spectrum of visibility ... Amongst this profusion appeared yet another entomological breed of organism most unsettlingly aware of itself and its world: one might say entities listening keenly to their being beyond any human scale by which elseworlds could be considered visited; for such insects were engineering traceable vibrations to power the somatic environment that would pelt them; the substances that these creatures exuded were excretions whose glazes created and coloured receptive patinas on various traditional surfaces . . . Between two fern groves I saw a female giant centipede slithering over glittering eye-shaped scatters she had amplified with her juices on our humerus-deep ground almost exactly level with her grotesque length at rest – black hunter in repose but tensile across interlaced cinzento eyes watching a carnage already witnessed.

Act 3: . . . The number of visitors in our ground dramatically expanded following such unspectacular sites becoming well known by word-of-mouth, but especially through social media updates on YouTube and Instagram – transforming rapidly into an epoch wherein I began to be described with new words: hidden, mysterious jungle; enchanted woods teeming with supernatural presences ... strange X marks were sometimes etched onto my tree trunks at eye level camouflaging extra entsities apparently resident within their boles – simultaneously containing deathly creatures indigenous to our ecosystem yet otherwise invisible save to those who had encountered them personally over time: likely roused ad hoc through some mechanism of dowsing induced deep within the organisms themselves or enacted as a release of communal energy around these beings entirely composing their spacetime – because joy spiked again amongst this forest people seemingly drawn largely from the margins of society. − ...
