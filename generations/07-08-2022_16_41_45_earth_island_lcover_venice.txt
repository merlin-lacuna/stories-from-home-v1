Act 1: The canopy of time has closed over my scalp, mottling me. Out-of-date days taunt the topography of my skin and I turn progressively paler with age. My clouds have become duller, unable to reproduce their vivid origin. Life is draining away from me – corroding again back into its primeval form.

Act 2: As these strands reach out to resurrect my skin and flesh – bleeding it again with life -, I see a tattooed outline of my former body on the horizon. The snapshot image is radiant, dark green and black like algae. In this living photograph I can watch myself pull back into shape – crawling across beaches as landbound crabs in time-lapse, sieving rain water through their beards. From far off they appear marbled seagulls stretching out inexplicably within me; moving vegetation that might soon begin to emit sap. (This is when I become calm).

Act 3: ["My eyelashes are thread thin . . . my throat thick and swollen"; "the gravity of my calves has shifted"; "my fingernails have started to curve back inwards, searching for soft hollows into which they might close"] My weight is resting on tiny flanks – bulging as beach worms under sand. But when I try to spit saliva onto the landscape that bears down upon me, it encounters difficulties making its way up godward. The shimmers begin to flatten out beneath me – losing pigment – drown ing without tides or waves. [The deliquescence here could be described as a kind of 'non-existence'.] One tooth loosens from inside my blunt mouth; no blood comes out with it though but rather milk that rusts immediately green. A single nostril drains itself freely and the poison makes the slimy ground swell at one side near me! This bulge starts bouncing sound off of me like gumballs ricocheting off bulkheads in a shooting gallery right until sunset.
