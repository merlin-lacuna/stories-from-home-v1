Act 1: I feel time passing. Even my blood moves slowly between my veins. Hardly a sound can be heard, as if everything had fallen into silence so deep it could drown the ocean in its potent inertia, but there is no wind to rock this aquatic peace that washes me like one more inconsequential desert … [The vague memory of broken waters] And where once there were hills and valleys they water now; what was dry land has become a swampy lake … The strange fear of seeing the earth vanish beneath a sheet of mirror-like liquid frightens even me.

Act 2: <poem>Now that the trees have halted their movement, lost their sap and broken off at the branch …</poem> The ground is now peopled by lizards on the ancient mission of marking it with dry scales. Dust infiltrates everything; each leafless frond outlining tepid pools in a desert only those sad palms can see … Moisture has abandoned me altogether and I cannot find within myself (like one more dried fruit) any sweetness to satisfy or revive my juices or lament softly over stealing caresses … Weeds merely exist like rough buds wrapped in smoke.

Act 3: ---- Land: I dream of the smell of water. The rain is mocking me and takes on all the shapes of desire in my disheveled imagination … The weatherbeaten skies have remained so gloomy that only those who, like me, see inside can tell they still exist … Sometimes weasel clouds seem to free themselves entirely from their substance as if taking pure pleasure in abandoning it altogether.
