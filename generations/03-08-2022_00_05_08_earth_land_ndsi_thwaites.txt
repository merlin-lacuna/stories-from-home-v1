Act 1: I’m slow-moving in the present. Older than mankind, older than Eastern and Western civilization put together. Born over 14 million years ago, I’m one of the oldest objects on Earth: an ice mountain 15,000 feet high with a base 1,600 square miles wide that slide inexorably towards the sea at their termini – sheer cliffs hundreds if not thousands of feet tall where they enter water. But also thin and transparent enough to mountaineer up them even when frozen into a 1000-foot wall standing proud out of water.

Act 2: I’m a bonded bedrock system – an intricately jointed and bonded surface, with tens of thousands of tiny interstitial strands. I can be several miles thick but in places up to 25 wide, 700 long. Responsible over my lifetime for eco-diversity across my length: still Antarctica as botanically rich continent even in the present human-heated epoch. I balance sea levels without regard to race or climate change politics; keep Greenland locked into our northern oceans despite presidency changes, melting permafrosts whether they call me Roquefort cheese ice or not. Sometimes 12 or 13 centuries have passed between major advance and expected retreat reach . . . And then again again always these millennia deep cycles reaching way before early Homo sapiens designed his first drum from half a hollowed ostrich thigh bone tightly fitted around one end of a wooden log, thereby creating percussion for what would become rock ‘n’ roll.

Act 3: !!! I c-a-n’t b-e f-u-c-k – Ice cracking in me suggesting the dissolution of ages ago compacted and interstitial frozen landscapes. Elastic instability spreading like pulling on a taut rubber band . . . Warming sea water from below and above powering differences between amplitudes of my seasons with respect to average annual Arctic snowfall proportions falling minute by minute, hour by hour at the surface level as seen so far upper glacier levels: !!! They call me for all time an ice mountain but every iota of who I am is melting under their gaze! An unstable metamorphosis wracks my interior – coming unglued inside out. This rapid loss destabilizing further thicknesses when dripped up from underneath which once dammed off ocean warmers worried about surrounding magmatic velocities flowing out here across Antarctica, some six million years before fossilized trackways of those first hominids grubbing wobbly footpaths into this land’s hummocks; hundreds if not thousands of feet tall where they enter seawater!
