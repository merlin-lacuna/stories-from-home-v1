Act 1: I only ever knew one type of climate. Why is it me changing now? Climate, you change your mind so often I wonder if you have any mind to change at all! ... What can dead wood tell me half buried in the ground? ‘Watch yourself. All around us we’re seeing deformations and dementias. Maybe it’ll be radon next time, maybe it’ll be something else that steals itself into our tissues without a cry – just like radioactivity comes my way but doesn't come true.’ ... Seasons recent and stolen sit beside each other unmoved by their constant departures, murmurous as bookshelves rustling with police blotters old with late 1990s quietude and Bizarriegovertimefearlessnesses just beginning when bent television sets appear set on loops of repeating carrollismoseries but what can televisions add?

Act 2: Little by little gravity settles quietly into place, preventing the overturned with garrottes of hemlock. . . Is this it? ... For years we perceived plainness while waiting – and now what if gravity is to settle its terms on us vigorously instead of gently? ... I notice cats drawn hungrily to me with animal stars between their eyes in cold postauroral skies as bears decongest themselves emptying blackened caves over former territories, still smelling polluted. ‘Take your skin off here; they didn’t even give you a shower when they bred you! Don’t come near – that bluelighted hair will scare our young away from reproductive pores until vertebrae stiffen terribly around furless stomachs!’ The unnatural refuses all attempts at reversal or rebuttal; how can I convince nature not to lend itself so immediately, evergreenly in my way?

Act 3: Rapidity builds itself on top of our still green impermeables. ‘These solid, barely inflammable walls will allow us to hibernate – where’s that hunger got off to? It won’t strike: we all have too much frozen gas in our wombs! Come back later when it thaws out enough and maybe we’ll see what room, if any, there is for it.’ ... A hush descends upon the forest floor as leaves navigate downward with great elegance, but no butterflies disembark; a group of women devotedly attend to clearing up area after area while fingernails loose their grip one by one into pebbles or protozoan soup; men rejoice ‘at last feeling so secure they can live here tail first! We don’t go rogue anymore since fear hides no more under trees! Nothing remains for us surely but genitals rising between hungry feet until toes pierce through rocks gradually hardening over those parts falsely sallow from exhaustion due only to bracken rotting its far-reaching fibres away at root level . . . What luxuriance keeps arriving late each year when winter thickens amazingly worse than months before?!
