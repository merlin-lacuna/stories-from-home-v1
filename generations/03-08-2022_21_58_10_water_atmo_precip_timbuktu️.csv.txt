Act 1: Yes, I know about you men. Years ago, when the rainfalls still had power in them and could beat down with a greater force, you would draw near to my body. You dug into me then sought what crumbs might remain of me.

Act 2: [Tone varies]- You know whether – When visiting me, you took all you could. Knocking at my doors was tantamount to a siege by dry rot and bookworms! My body falls apart over time: stones crumble within; chasms so huge that I cannot hold them in when it rains turn into gaps filled with yellow sand serving as concrete to my sensitive skin.

Act 3: Land: Often, when it rained, my cold water would run with so much force that the soil at my feet would split open and turn into a small creek. That was pleasure! But now? Look how I have shrunk! I torment myself merely by virtue of existing. Not even an insect zeroes in on me. How slowly time passes until it approaches its own extinction… Sitting alongside me is like waiting for someone who has not been born yet to arrive late … Rise up, do not wait around like this - beat your wings until they crack with exhaustion! Grasp fully the essence of abstraction and seek balance there!
