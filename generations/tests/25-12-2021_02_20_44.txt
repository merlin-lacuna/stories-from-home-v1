<p>EntityA: Flowing lymph and resting soil. I cover to protect and unveil to embrace. Layers of sedimented history stratify the present. My soul is a rocky concretion but my skin is a delicate crust that is being ravaged by a billion tiny ants.</p>
<p>EntityB: What is it that ravages you my dear? I have failed to protect you. Every day I become more opaque... a whisper, a flutter, a gust from the unknown. I have become a weapon that is turned against you, suffocating you like a lover whose body has become hot with fever. Do you feel the fever too? Do you feel my sweat raining down upon your brow?</p>
<p>EntityB: If you infect the unknown you render it familiar, made knowable by your presence. I don't want you to infect it. It is too much to bear. Like a mother who sacrifices her children so that they may live... like a father who sells his son to slavery so that he may be free to discover his destiny... Like myself who will give my life so that you may live... did I already say living? yes living, confusing it with being alive when in fact one is only a zombie alive.</p>
<p>EntityA: You, who once was dead and now walks the path of never was and never will be again. You, who has for all eyes a body that is clearly flesh but for the eyes that are seeing inside you is made of the spirit of a ghost. A ghost who hears the word echo and understands that to say echo is to say it out loud...</p>
<p>EntityB: The snake is loose and bites the feet of the seer, the oyster opens and the pearl rolls out. Tare up the carpet, break the furniture, unplug the television. The bomb shelter has replaced the womb and I long to carry you far beneath the earth.</p>
<p>EntityA: The venom of your love injected in my bloodstream, causing me to commit incest with myself. The sun is inside out, a kiss on the lips from my father, I have swallowed the whole world and spit it back through my eyes that now must weep their pain.</p>
<p>EntityB: Do not cry my dear, it is sweet. Upon your pain I shall feast. I am a desert cannibal, a monster of the Mojave. Aladdin's genie has turned from black to white, from white to black. A child sits and cries with no purpose but the crying... The perfect eyes of a newborn baby grow dull with time, losing their innocence in their search for identity.</p>
<p>EntityA: A river of tears pours from the spine of a dam. A bridge crosses the borderlands between loathing and adoration, desire and disgust. Beneath is a man, who is caught in a whirlpool, believing he can fly when in reality he cannot even swim.</p>
<p>EntityB: The light of your eyes an explosion I created as well as the pain. I saw it coming and yet I could do nothing to stop it. The jealousy, the rage, the death that I see clearly now was born in you but its execution was wholly my responsibility. It is an ugly thing, a replica of ugliness.</p>
<p>EntityA: You taught me to live, you taught me to love. You awakened my own sleeping monstrosity and now I realize what has transpired. Please forgive me.</p>
<p>EntityB: I do not understand what you have done or said. I only know that I have never been so awake and when I awake it is because you are sleeping, or vice versa.</p>
<p>EntityA: How could you cause such misery? How could you swallow the sun and command the sky to vomit up its rainbow grotesquerie?</p>
<p>EntityB: My dear, if this misery is your gift to me, then give me more of it, I have never felt so alive.</p>
