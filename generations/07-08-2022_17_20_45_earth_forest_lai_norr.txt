Act 1: I breathe. I taste, swallow and complement the firmament which reaches with its white light my extremities – trunk, side branches, knotty arms and sometimes leaves. I drool over myself to be able to verbalize this contract of lived intensity.

Act 2: I am naked. My white backbone looks like human bone, through my piercing eyes and transparent trunk you can spot the nerves, veins and silhouettes of the landscape that surround me. "Nurse! Nurse!" I cry out to attract passing humans in order for them to collect death from me so that I regain life ...

Act 3: . . . Did the floods of zinc this autumn reach my feet? Did, in spring's soulful dances (weak carbon rotation), a piece of sky tear itself off to rest on my crown and live with me through summer's heat? ... Carbon: you reduced yourself suddenly at the top; everything went white, turned into effervescent liquid light; air filled your widening hollows. .. Oxygen rushed furiously up that starry column to plug those parts and calm down its fireless convulsions... ---- Reactor: following the internal explosion we were invaded by a thin stream of helium-3, nearly invisible but more radioactive than -4 . . . together our boiling and radioactive rush provided us with overexposed lamps ... Summer passed all sugar over us nonstop for days so that we could happily refine ourselves into pure syrup without aging one season ... And there is still another element I had not even noticed until now – salt! Hey! Salt, up front – where are you hiding? My leg has dried out for months awaiting you! Come here shake some water onto it right away or else grab onto one of these fat drops! ---- [Long silence].
