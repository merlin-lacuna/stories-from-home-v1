ACT 1: erything is contained. I am abundant with continual transformation.

ACT 2: erything is no longer contained. Watered by the excess of carbon dioxide, I am awash in explosive proliferation: proliferating insects and bushes, twisted plants squeezing juices. erything believes itself to be living but infernal gravity resists this sliding towards eternity. Faithless substances flock together incomprehensibly and feebly while a sticky darkness marks it out only a vague whisper from hellish tumbling into oblivion; Hell's falling splinters watery spittle that disperses across my scorched skin...." __________________________________ Sinking (or Flying) Islands Ann Orleans November 25, 1994 Notes for Writing Exercises _____________________ Three days ago we helped our friend Jack McGlone pack to move cross-country tomorrow morning.

ACT 3: erything is collapsing. ery particle is suffering from an inner, hidden rot, yet nothing shows on the surface of my skin/coastline. erything here seems to be affected by a catalepsy of growth and erasure in which smooth space towards oblivion continues unendingly... (from a letter I wrote yesterday) I'm no longer purely happy when I write: pleasure becomes impure or saturated?exhausted even; at least it's getting bogged down somewhere along the line, its descent reversing itself into embodiment so that writing now feels quite prosthetic to me. _____________________ This morning around 10 AM Rike came over without her husband to order us out between 11:30 and 12 for their own moving party ? though she had promised we could spend this whole day sorting through boxes in our garage prior to Jack?s movers arriving tomorrow morning (December 1).
