Act 1: I suffer from anemia. My veins are consciously empty, as if they had been cut open with a glass bottle. The southern heat returns to my skin like an echo of the qualities it once possessed in other skies cloudless sympathy for aches, attraction and indifference both at once towards those who may adore or hunger after me.

Act 2: I have gone drowned. My fluid transparency drapes my surface now and seeks the succor only a stranger can give. The water knows no natural boundary and occupies all niches, as if it were neither liquid nor airy grime clinging to an invisible soul.

Act 3: Not all paths are clear, not all outlines distinct: I am in an embryonic stage of lakes and tentative flowers. These elements combine to remake my presence as pure water and pastel light, hybrid sensations replete with buds that at times burgeon or come apart into indifferent rain â€¦ . My skin reknits around gestures from the bottom of a newly seductive sunset.
