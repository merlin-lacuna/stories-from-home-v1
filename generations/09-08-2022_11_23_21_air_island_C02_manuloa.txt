Act 1: ************ In such conditions, my pollen is difficult to release. ********** I am only able to scatter it under a hot sun onto scorched ground where the life juices already exude from the bare earth and bravely struggle for substance in the bitterest of arenas. ************ My seed easily shrivels up immediately on contact with dry ground. ************ Strange clumps then form from mildewed spores and harden into rocks which often roll away down a slope or give off a rancid odor that alienates any animal seeking nourishment. --- Parchment scum forms on my scars; white birds screech violently above caves hazy with humid heat haze whilst mosquitoes suck their blood - even though they stink themselves like rotten carrion?Parchment thins as soon as it becomes moistened by water through infusions of tropical rainstorm dew: plants are greener than ever before along meadows filled with flowers brilliant and ornate, but without acidity ... ?Despair has so fully pervaded everything around here that no animal can find adequate food; all have fled en masse because they fail to discover plant odour nor see colour or movement anywhere .....

Act 2: ************ My dry plants perish on the march. ********** Dry grass scatters everywhere, torn loose by wild winds, landing far away near cold streams and frozen ponds. ************ I am permeated with moist rotting smells.. --- The fingers of my treetops catch hold sadly within the shackles made from tepid pollen dust which fuses itself into rough metal chain links molded to my limbs ....... ----

Act 3: ************ The shadows of rocks and pits traps moisture to fester within the cave floors. ********* Hangings that glow become chilled by night.?From infected tricklings, I split open in all my parts?With horror at life that slides away whilst desiring completion, I am like oil mixed with sand.... ������� What else is there to do but fertilize a desert land. ���� By now it's hopeless. ************ ---- Atemwende / Breathing Change No one can escape breathing utterly, every creature returns endlessly toward breath: day and night every human draws breath without once thinking what this natural secondhand process might be which links each of our daily lives most intimately .
