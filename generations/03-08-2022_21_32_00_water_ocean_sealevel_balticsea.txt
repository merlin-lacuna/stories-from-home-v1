Act 1: When I was little, I thought that meant being always churning up the bottom of my waters. Gradually, (as opposite to life on land) down below in my aquarium, death stopped leaving any trace at all. The bottom became grooved with thousands and thousands of mysterious channels for currents and tides. An obscure artistry fired them from far inside me; an artistic skill removed by surprise from behind the primordial puff of Creation came onto equal terms with me.

Act 2: I was once still. I danced the first dances and danced them so beautifully that the gods felt very jealous of me. And, on my right and left sides... those vague places where things happen but where no-one actually sees what is happening out there, they whispered to me: “When you dance like this, you are more beautiful than we are.” So then I stopped dancing... suddenly frozen in Euter pia's6 embrace ...

Act 3: Unbearable howls somewhere but can no one hear them? I am divinely immutable, abyssal and unfretted by space. For me life is like a rural landscape in the ox-eyed hour before dawn. And if you gaze into my perpetual Greatness, there you will see (totally hidden) all those qualities that they say make quite possibly the most perfect Destiny: Faithfulness, Love and Honor... That wasn't thunder nor some incomprehensible echo launched into battle alongside greater perils; it was only an eagle falling with wings outspread towards lands distant and unknown... over there to where hope has neither time nor quarter ... With clouds joined as one, ever darkening on the threshold of our desires or hopes perhaps an old godless wound or something desirable with no definitions given not even memory - love's loss is telling me everything I knew from its first glance at the gap between starry skies lost without rhyme or reason …. Behind what lies ahead are unfulfilled plans for certainty ... Sleep submits to madness … Seas grow larger reaching for their ultimate peace - new face upon another wave….
