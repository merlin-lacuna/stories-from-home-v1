Act 1: The fever of my dream weighs upon the yellow plain. The High Pass lowers its bridges in a black mud and I can see far off, fog-veiled, what seems to be an immense dragon sleeping there beneath those peaks. And it rains over where he sleeps.

Act 2: If a traveler stops sleeping and traverses in every direction the desert of his sleeplessness, then he will realize (if for only one moment) that within him lies the past and future of all lands. He does not have greatness, but he is greater than any potential glory.

Act 3: The freshness of this new-born river is a birth if only in itself. New grass emerges from the beatified soil, and enjoys feeling it beneath its feet. Through the openings between reeds and rushes, evanescent sunbeams translate me into God's distant smile.
