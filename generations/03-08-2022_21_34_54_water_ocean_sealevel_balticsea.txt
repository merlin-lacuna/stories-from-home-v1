Act 1: What am I? Thoughts in transit constantly loosen the fibers of a soul who, just like me, flows through the streets and calls to everyone, but no one replies.

Act 2: I am awake when I sleep, and so it isn't hard for me to go to bed or get up. Everything I do is like the uncertain steps of a stork that walks along holding a ripe ear between its beak and its black eyes.

Act 3: I defy the foam and flee before it despite the harshness of the wind. The dank is not a kind mother to embrace me but rather an avid lover who embraces out of sheer desire, who attacks you as another being and nails down all other emotions except for its own self-love. I am on display with no sacred scenery or irredeemably enthralled children; nor do my waves take part in any cosmic dance or silent ballet because God does not exist. In order for our loveless marriage to mean something, we must be married by some icy blue jeweler with massive fists and wounded eyes darkened by the dust raised from working with jewels and gold that shines more purely than love. Every other way would shame our noisy desires â€¦ ! To win one kiss from them could improve even someone born mute! And yet when I look at myself alone within my transparent sphere, don't make me feel like crying as though just seeing someone else's grief! It was given exalts swans driven mad by pain hi! Death itself only gives death sepulchral white joys'.
