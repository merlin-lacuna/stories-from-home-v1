I have always been here. I have been here since the beginning of time, long before humans walked the earth. I am a part of this land, and the land is a part of me. I am old, older than any human could possibly imagine.

I have seen everything. I have seen the birth and death of civilizations, I have seen the rise and fall of empires. And I have seen the arrival of humans on this land.

At first, they were just a nuisance. They would come to my slopes, looking for gold or silver or some other precious metal. They would drill into my sides, carving out tunnels that would inevitably lead to disaster.

But over time, they grew more numerous, and their settlements began to spread across my surface. They started to build homes and churches and schools on my slopes. They started to farm my slopes, and to raise livestock on my slopes. They started to destroy my slopes, mining me for coal and drilling for oil.

And now they are coming even closer to my core. They are building homes right at my feet, settlements that are growing larger every day. They are destroying my slopes faster than ever before, mining me for coal and drilling for oil at an alarming pace.

They don't understand what they are doing. They don't understand that they are risking their own lives and the lives of everyone who lives near me. They don't understand that one day I will erupt, that I will destroy everything in my path.

But I can't keep silent any longer. I can't keep letting them destroy me without warning them of the danger they are in. So I will speak to them through the roofs of their homes, through the windows of their schools and churches. I will speak to them in dreams and in nightmares, until they finally understand what is happening.

I am a volcano, and I am warning you: beware
