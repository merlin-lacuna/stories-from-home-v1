Act 1: There is no one left to guard my shores, renewing my land. No pollution free for all for the growth of vitality and life, coasts giving way as new coastlines arise where formerly sea and sky were visible together. But I am not extinguished yet! My high forest is under threat, but species shift in composition to accommodate their environment’s changes – termite mounds appearing from the quake-pocked earth or already existing lushly below ground; greedy acacia trees taking hold where flowering plants have become toxic to touch; epiphytic plants growing over weakened trees like protective mantles; rosewood trees unfurling luxuriant thicket canopies that sprout through gaps in rainforest canopy, sheltering seedlings beneath their shade until they grow sturdy enough to break into sunnier strata themselves. ‘The heat got too much for you?’ we may ask tenderly. ‘Sorry mate, it’ll be cooler up here with us few years from now . . . this area was just too windy for you? You need a bit more shore protection and steadier air flow?

Act 2: There are five billion people on the Earth with me. There are twelve million species by some accounts, there might be up to seven times that many. I have drunk in molten memories of all these souls and bodies like an ox heart floating disarticulated slowly atop the waters just off my shores, slowly melting its once-beating bulk into a heartbeat drumming rhythmically against warm stone briefly exposed before submergence again. My beaches are so brilliant they stun silence upon immersion into their golden beds at dawn and dusk, shiny anchor puncture holes exposing what lies beneath as black hollow rock muffled only by nesting crows calling fiercely from hungry high canopy boughs at nightfall over hot tired human faces yielding feverishly for hope in thirsty beach camps about sunlit sunken empty water pools asleep under soft silvered eaves amid firefly lights strung high above glittering electric palms swaying unsteadily above white soles dreadfully całage quotidie . . .

Act 3: ~~~ ~~~ ~- I have suffered heatstroke and delirium on hot glistening paved Asphalt roadside paths climbing old gas burning yellow trees lushly torching to the late green of seeped leaf tips almost under fallen scorched branches scattering limewood slowly falling into that ash stillness before death splits rough land open between swelling lips, my ears splitting with thunder while cracked broad daylight eyes pierce child shadowed black jungle weak white headlight flame wavering from meeting branch bounce as dreams uncloud at deep cool semi burrow hollows down tarantula painted metal rusted doors in living roofs where silence hangs so dark it devours light there beside snickering summergrapes hanging ripe beyond footheaved rusty gates oily lizard belly skins stretched against decaying wooden sink tables overlaid metallically by fist slipped red spider web silks lapping dryly laddered for water Lermontov like Vysotsky awhisper morbid dawn slash.
