Act 1: This is what I have been, who I was: one prominent ice mass connected by hundreds and hundreds of kilometres to other prominent masses. Our party of glaciers moving together in a massive system slowly towards the sea. This was my nature, which as you can see has no antithesis, nothing rugged or dangerous – this is why they imagined me safe at least until after next century’s end.

Act 2: My climate is still not the one you have: here, winters freeze in totality a portion of the surface – and everything freezes up regularly. Hereabout there exists elements ascending from matter that only yield to organic life.

Act 3: My lowlands were attached forests reaching the beginning of summer lightning and swaying over sub marine springs accessible only to whales ... my high grounds became open fields flourishing beneath warm glaciers that climb with the climate. These yet known elements are for me almost nightmares: their configuration is destabilizing, hard to present as a whole that does not contradict itself. And so their ensemble becomes less illustrated by history than by immediate feeling – it’s this putting together tensioned without any outlet other than conflagration which in me drives you.
