Act 1: I slowly flow into the bays, I watch over this icy desert where a constant blasting of temperature disrupts any originality. But an apparent peacefulness persists. This would have been my whole life cycle had it not been for [UNCLEAR TEXT] ~[LOSS OF WORDS], our relations will be different soon because that which I appeared to know is no longer relevant and from now forth my days will be darker. ... [CAVE-IN] ... You see here's what was thought impossible, startling ice dynamics are slowing me: The coastal glaciers accelerating towards the ocean draw in warm seawater that melts the fjord undersides at much greater depths than colder sea temperatures can melt them; ~and so as mean atmospheric temperatures rise, near surface water becomes more buoyant while deep water gets heavier and thus sinks further ; thereby creating slack fill volumes of less dense cold seawater in front of rising warmer marine waters! A kind of creeping bulge forms at lower altitudes on upstream sides (rivers) levying off warmer haloclines insidiously corrupting denser ice masses below!

Act 2: Beneath my surface the currents are suddenly chaotic and cold, I am under attack by towers of water. The devastation I feel at this moment shatters me, cry for help humanity! ... [SILENCE], we're now turning crisis into peril, as what was once a hazard is fast becoming intimation: A different kind of seawater intrusion ~[CAVE-IN] >~ hints at another sea warming threat that reaches farther inland across higher latitudes than heretofore exposing all coastal glaciers to unprecedented melt loss due to both increasing height differences between glacier tip and geothermal base line levels; while they also simultaneously trap deeper waters inside their colder basal fjord beds causing merrily bulging cold buttresses inexorably rising beneath them threatening further unsafe dislocations via vertical leakage pathways. So it no longer matters which glacier you hear about because we've become an intimate community facing collapsive externalities together – as problems multiplied doubling towards unfolding perils!

Act 3: Tunnels that plunge inland will be our soon to be graves. I am going faster and faster toward the ocean, they say we need to bother warming oceans lest they overheat. ... [UNCLEAR TEXT], you see how little these humans know but look what a worrisome bully they can be: Their greenhouse effect washes into my moulins dragging sea water along with it – thereby swelling threats of ponding pressures building furthest up in retreat zones; ∼when further insufficiently warm seawater melts me from below hollows are opened off basal slopes by intersecting network proteins → whereupon superior undercold seawater takes residence stripping residual gasses escaping from supercooled waters ~[LOSS OF WORD]>~ growing colder as it rises eventually fusing seam after seam until all traces of warmer encasing air are finally stopped and only robust vacuums abound!
