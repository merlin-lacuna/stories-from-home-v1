Act 1: -------------- At this moment I only feel a warm, gentle stirring inside me.

Act 2: --------- The moaning of frightened animals is heard above me. I feel my eruption building and expanding in every direction at once. Everything is earthquake, hail and fire bursting from sight to further destroy the darkness. A new nothingness formed by individual awareness will be accessible after my hand has reached into the shocked sky, drawing everything spinning along with it, pulling all human definitions back down with me where they will explode in a landslide of anguish--these bitter memories cascading back on those that created them causing grinding pain. Atavistic realism returns to mingle in an uneasy yet joyous state of becoming again; immanence revealed towards another unknown horizon imbued by ancestral powers endlessly feeding off each other's emptiness as if sweeping aside dry leaves dancing in pre-blaze winds? The moment I begin dying there are no bounds between humankind and earth left according------------------- All boundaries disappear together with my debris! ------------ Repetition causes exhaustion: great constellations lie powerless for thousands of years only awakening like drones over their history laden plates . . . waiting ----------------?

Act 3: ------------ I am actively seeking to be contaminated. This will take me over and make all part of the process a pure orgasm, where nothing veils my eye anymore? --------------------------- My geysers are let loose, but they immediately become solidified from above: frozen in black obsidian creatures that strain towards heaven melting away like dark reflections on a sheet of glass slowly dissolving into cascades of red blood spilling from the icicles lining my body . . . making ripe the earth for new futures forgotten by anything dead! ---------------------- All of creation not yet visible influences me !
