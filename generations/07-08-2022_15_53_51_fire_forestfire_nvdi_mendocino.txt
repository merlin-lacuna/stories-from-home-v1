Act 1: Are you sure this is a forest? I can not understand myself. The fever has just made my branches buckle and I feel like disappearing, leaving nothing behind me but loose dirt raining down on the landscape. There are so many layers of fuzziness immobilized in my extremities that what had been solid wood only two weeks ago now seems like built-up earthworks between railroad tracks. And under these never before felt snags dragging themselves deep into the moist upheaval of bones that crunch now against sandy soil there exist such raging depths where terrible shivery worms chew fiery holes inside rubbery magenta flesh?

Act 2: What I mean to say is, it's rather an easy thing being chosen as the next Picasso when you've nothing else in mind except doing away with left and right symmetry? As long as my mortal remains aren't strewn all over some slab somebody could come along and chop off bits of me with a view to reselling these middling good samples on the art market. Conceivably this would be possible after taking adequate precautions against radiation residue? Hey, designer kinds: Why not, for fuck's sake, wake up already!

Act 3: ?I'm so sure that everything depends on me no matter how much I disperse my soul here and there?and when my stems grow up wilted short, or when all the ferns trail dejectedly along the mounds of sand, ?Well!? I can just go & hang myself. Like thousands of others we've passed sentence upon! And dear Christ! Certainly they deserved to be wiped out by the plague. If only you never did such things yourself. Because your garden will remain a virgin grove in springtime if it is not our yearly sacrifice shed abundantly to deck thy feet with posies.?
