Act 1: ???? (What is the air like?) We have already continued, I notice. ???? ? (Where do we go from here on out?) We run, who knows why? ??????(How are situations created? ?????????? Sore and paralyzed, I witness this failure of life's undertakings in a state Of grief which never clears up fully.This torpor paints all thresholds with shadows so that it seems not to exist, despite all my claims about being aliveâ€¦ ??????? ? ?? yet it slowly changes.] Sometimes some unusual zones alternate with joy, enclosing me between their good chances as though caught between two trains: one for death, the other for exaltation. These alternating waves then fall back again into mournful stagnation of pauses in waiting: Another failed struggle against interminable fatigue!Island: Despairing cries grow faint under cover of dense foliage which soon stifles them silently. Flashes move away too rapidly to be seen clearly but cast off a real glare nonetheless while fragmentary phrases reach us confused and distorted; thanks to wilfulness falling onto jagged ledges where their impact fractures them.... ....Auras seem to distort themselves amidst these sharp edges.....I speak back lovingly through calm gestures directed toward warm things discovered suddenly....

Act 2: ???? ?? ????, ? ?. (How can all existences realize And myself at the same time?) Frustrations, responsibilities, hopes and desires are a gulf enclosing everything as nothing comes to pass within me here."Look!" I dished out "Look how?

The arrows fly apart from my lyre ....... yet another day drifts past me promised by ships not carrying anything essential .........I raise up my exhausted eyes .....every mouth is repeating without knowing it...What strength would lift up this immense turpitude .

Act 3: ?????? ????. ? ?????,??? ? ??.?. (Round and round the suffocating wind rolls Without stopping astounded by its emptiness) Once again an endless autumn discolours all longing .........the crowd of those who await desires itself becomes a purely external thing? distant voices echo words that seem to have no relation with what we expect from them .......I am worn out looking for understanding between people...... without making any progress.Or rather I know more clearly yet even more fully what our silence is made from ......it is far more immense than anything we can reach individually..Perhaps .....we only apprehend it in great exhaustion following valiant efforts to achieve something worthwhile.......What value does it have?.... does truly reaching into oneself really permit bringing back something befitting existence?Inside me everything dwells within vast encrustationings of incomprehensible feelings whose beauty arrests me before the dwindling mirror......my lips move tremblingly towards unheard whispered song carried along impossible music's insufficiencies.....I sense that there are names at myheart which need urgently to leave this heavy moisture weighing down onbut failing to broaden ...perhaps there will benew fleets originating from glorious distances and worlds where life flows easily - but ........always temporarily stranded on this hellish island......We take demonic
