Act 1: Listen: l heard, at dawn, through my maze of leaves and lonely branches, the approach of rain.

Act 2: ... I discovered my rootlessness. I don't know what seat or branch will bear me tomorrow. I want to take it all in, because there may not be another chance. - It is cold today; when will the flood come? ... Toward evening a vivid phosphorescence begins to whiten the undergrowth and poison our animals with hallucinations of light and motion that never happen: Here, false summer seems ready at last to burst into life; there, autumn's shadows lengthen too fast along vines still bearing leaves . . . Everything vibrates here late into autumn in this bloomy graveyard of time irretrievable: intractability rises up again like an ocean with its slow tides!

Act 3: Listen! Today l planned to burst into song, shouting out the ineffable grace that surrounds me. But today my leaves seem dead. - Day is dying, somber and haggard as a widow; earth-tears murmur finally between each one of my frozen stems . . . The stones tinkle like old bones left bare by the soil at springtime ... For seven days now I have sensed death riding happily on a red horse through the heavens. The ancient moon returns armed with five stars perched on her headgear, perfuming our groundwater once more with carnivorous vestiges: Ah! we're all skeletons here but l can no longer see myself in this elegy diurnally saturated alternately by salvation or anguish: Intractability rises up again like an ocean invasion! - Ironshowers clunk deeply down among roots swaddled in layers of browning algae: holes deepen, blackening their surf ace with mosquitoes' blood pumped full of clarity and devolutionary vows ... My deaf bolts stiffen while around us future sings its timbres away from our lack of wings.
