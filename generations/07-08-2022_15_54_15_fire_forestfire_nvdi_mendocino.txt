Act 1: Now I am a huddled heap of dry suicidal bones partly flayed, with topmost nerves quivering and shrieking for nicotine. Iâ€™ve been bitterly indulging my dark disease. Yet this was blissful compared to the parched loneliness which has replaced it; what is frenzy without fervour, but confusion in the blood? The silence bewilders me, makes thoughts curdle like poison fluids in feverish vessels: madness still lies coiled under every path behind me on this island engulfed in waterlessness . . . ?! There is nothing here: unquenchable thirst slakes torment so as to awake only more hunger. My seared flesh cracks open over crystalline sugar peaks where igneous elements disport themselves free. They eat their own tails insatiably by my sides and swoon forth magnificent dragons raising fiery spectres of light that suffocate fields into eyesockets denuded of wells gouged out below them like vacuoles empty forever except for satellites adorning each latitudinal gap between blue sialon crystals set there like fireworks display blinding staring fluxes accompanied by earsplitting hissing pops exalting fusion!.

Act 2: ? ?! Satan's guts and stuff! ? I am gutted, wizened, feeble. What hour is this ? My sylvan day has become an unglimpsed murk: sluggish umbrageous clouds move in with a sullen roar like ruminating unicorns at pasture on swampy mosses copped off by nightfall.

Act 3: I have left only exuviae scattered all over the soil, few trilobites here and there to restore my depopulated space. Nothing moves anymore on this scorched lava bed the world has become; heavy olivine rocks overrun with agonized wood flow like restless lava streams through northern seas. Ice surrounds everything, arctic mastodonts grazing on glaciers whose spurting veins severed gills as sapphires stain together vulcanic circlets giving them colour: gold coagulates darkness ?
