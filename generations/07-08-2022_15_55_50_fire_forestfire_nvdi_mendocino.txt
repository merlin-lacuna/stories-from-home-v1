Act 1: ------------flames have invaded everything, leaving only a few charred twigs and no greenery! What’s going to become of me? Why do they want my death?! ---- The four-legged beast has disappeared. Only the fire remains.

Act 2: ------------the air becomes more thick and heavy. A weight is smothering the shrubbery. Everything looms up with no clear contour, devoid of lightness and transparency. ---- Days go by without the sun showing itself so much as a pale disk on the horizon: there are no cocks‚ crows to herald it in the fullness of its radiance, just anxious silence under limp clusters that let their leaves fall like tears trickling down burning cheeks harshly pricked by a million pains! So now when I touch my branches I nearly shed tears from pure joy: I am relieved to have something absolutely firm again, see once more trees standing perfectly upright; but when will things bear fruit? Is this forest strong enough yet for its flowers? ---- An awful lethargy emanates from crevices deeper than sleep ? almost primal shuddering such as might cock my eyelids open tout a coup at first light only further to hope for slumber or better still never ever wake up! Nothing's moving anymore.... nothing...can't move anymore...ah well!. My vainly thrust-out roots drink maddening bits of earth baked dry under these fiery eye levels where even bouquets seem dead. But who cares...?

Act 3: ------------No more glory on the mezzanine, nor sighs from Beethoven above. An overgrowth of phantoms creeps in: fevers, typhus ? yet all these nice little ghosts have vanished miserably into their rotten mummies. ------------ It's a sunny day and I am alive!
