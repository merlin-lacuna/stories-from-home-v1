Act 1: ????So I dream of an earthquake which will tear open fissures in my skin. ????Mammoth cracks riven through the links between volcanoes and saddles. ????And this air charged with a thousand drams of snow, suddenly transformed into steam, what terrible energy it would liberate? ????Who could deny me this underground thrill?^^^^^

Act 2: ????What is it within you that doesn't experience life? ????Why does death make any sense at all to me? ????Incessant activity covers my skin, from the thin sheen of sulphur on all my surfaces down to the silent quaking of what must be an archaeology within. ????Loneliness seems only for me without meaning; because, around me and in me, there's no greater emptiness than when I'm with those who would understand this loneliness. ????Because of excess heat now, even here behind sixty feet of living rock it feels like being under a closed oven. ?????Straight into Hell's moulds poured unsullied liquid rock and lava wormhole to glowing abysses ..........only recently were two cities built on my slopes where previously there had only been settlements scattered among villages. (note: different city is repeated twice here) ........my solfataras belching forth scarlet smoke carry sorrow ......And still the rains don't cure things; they just swell them out...... .........It's good that bodies are heavy: if they weren't then mouths and kissing would exhaust us too much...........Allegorically thinking about lost hope deluges everything..................if our slums disgrace beauty let them also have their pride

Act 3: ????About me, travel can only be described abstractly: as an induced absence. ????Destinations remain improbable, beautiful changes will happen to other lives than mine......the fickle birds fall mute in ruins and nothing remains but delicately stirring breath. ????You will keep struggling with growing precipitation.......heavy air hanging full of the aftertaste of failure........you have lost yourselves......... .........Incessant activity covers my skin from the thin sheen of sulphur on all its surfaces down to the silent quaking inside another kind of archaeology ........My vegetative exuberance has now turned completely mineral ........I lean against myself because IÃ­ve found out that a hardened life such as mine is pleasure .....................pollen falling from steel wool would fertilise real wheatfields ..............Not just loneliness.
