Act 1: Coincidently you come visit me ... A human being? Nothing more than a drop of water placed on top of my endless thirst. -- I do not feel anything when you arrive, but if your stay becomes permanent then maybe something will change within this organism that I am and whose elements have just been weakened by the winds of time. ---- Human Being: ---- You call yourself "human being." This little word has too much meaning to allow an understanding within it yet those who take refuge in its depths fail to recognize this fact! I become irritated each time my thin screen is pierced with your puffing-out monikers: mother-earth, fatherland etc., - these names should be burnt rather than given by man; they are absolute deceptions preventing people from living in reality through thick veils called false instincts/myths. ---- Inside myself there is neither hut nor home for any metaphor based on such deep obscurities!!

Act 2: ???? ???? ??? Don't confuse yourself with my regions. ???? There are thresholds approaching? towards which I proceed in shame and joylessness, but these are cut off by complexes born of mad mental desire. ????? You make me a little unsilk-like and weave me into total divisions! ---- Human Being: the human being comes closer from distant lands to see this geological structure that seems almost alien, as if sustained through struggle for survival yet no longer possessing its fulcrum or balanced centre, hopelessly dry to all appearances ... His gestures speak of recognition/misrecognition, some primitive closeness between consciousnesses ... Yet he doubts himself, unable??'tO find within this static oddity his own energetic centres ? where consciousness has always been the very basis of human existence ........ The land personifies itself because the human being cannot comprehend it without personality attribution; we need personal stories not impersonal functions nowadays ......

Act 3: ???? ???? this crater is what I can never fill with my waves ... at last an endless vacuum?such beauty, for you because it passed through me! But so lonely once again. right to the core .... As if no one ever happened in here .....Seems like there's not something just once!? If you step upon this soil on empty feet, then I astonish myself ...... Every sound of yours that stops here rises into floating silence .... as though touched by lightning twice while a raindrop enters between us ! .... Was I already somewhere and lost it all? ????? Human Being: You have sunk deeply inside the land's hot pores. Under its damage your life begins to crackle continuously, searching away from harmony toward dissonant interruptions....... The human being has been captured by the same climate that supports him yet does not accept him permanently .......... He stands over reality singing about ancient ideals he sees now to be shattered and transitory .............
