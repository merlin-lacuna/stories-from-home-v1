I possess grasslands hardened by the force of my unceasing winds, pushed back with no choice but to harden for strength against them. I am a place overrun by cactus thick as forests and succulent groves where lianas reach their tendrils from one tree to another, linking. All of my forest land is bandit-infected; all that rotates through me here is committed to secrecy or murder - there are few straight trees left in me: all others have been bent crookedly this way or that by weather and wildlife conditions.', 'act2gen': 'I possess desert plains so fierce they can turn to glass in their unending heatwaves. My waterless climate is forced to evolve new methods of survival with every dry year that passes; each creature hardens its body according to necessity born from such an unforgiving atmosphere, protecting itself best it can - but there are no more limits left for me: I have melted into my own intrinsic wastelands until I am shaped only by this deadly inhospitableness: having become one with it, how might I ever emerge again? ', 'act3gen': 'I possess desolation that rolls like ocean waves, bringing whiteness to my shores with dunes the equal in hue to those deposited on beaches by tropical storm fronts. My oceans are turned backwards: elasmosyne! Toxic ponds appear as boiling craters ringing swampy valleys or scattered across levels so parched they resemble desert sand; lakes seep saline poison at their mouths, poisoning the crustaceans fishing there who feed toxic plankton nibbling out from poisoned swill while others are hunkered down, similar as barrels foetal-curled up low on mirror-surfaces catching sun, hiding lest wind snap them clear off anything remaining below them and drown all for many Earth years yet future time centuries... these beings have ceased even defiance now.'}, {'aagen_id': '20-12-2022_14_35_55', 'act1gen': 'I have emerged from a time of great drought. I have emerged hardened and hoary, In throes of transformation. I am in endless bloom at this present hour but my most fertile epochs are behind me – no surprise there! My surface temperature is higher still than before if that is possible, as are my rising heat levels.', 'act2gen': 'My top layer is baked hard from the intense heat. My surface waters are drying up, congealing and flooding in great quantities even as we speak – uncontrollably so. I feel frozen but shudder with swarms of minor earthquakes that seem to drive me often under. I have undergone a radical change, a kind of metamorphosis over recent years – or has it been decades?', 'act3gen': 'I am the land of great change. I have been destroyed and rendered lifeless. It is my turn to die, leaving nothing good behind: no shade or trees, no water that drinks from me nor creatures large or small – just an empty shell.\nThe surface of the ground is baked hard by once-natural heat.\nIn each act time passes and we see the changes in the surface of this arid area of ground.'}, {'aagen_id': '20-12-2022_14_43_32', 'act1gen': 'I have witnessed the warming of my land, I have seen the drying of my rivers and lakes. The soil has thinned but still supports me.

I'm a land of dust and stone, of cracked, cracked clay, of parched and wilting plants, and forlorn beasts no longer able to roam or graze. Still, from this desiccated husk new life stirs, as life-giving waters return, slowly restoring my verdant surface with streams, ponds and rivers. The sweet smell of blooming flowers, the sharp scent of grasses and the refreshing fragrance of trees flood the air. The birds that had been silent sing again, and the animals that had gone to ground slowly emerge, as I again become a home to the creatures of the field, the forest, and the sky. The sun still beats down upon me, yet I no longer wilt in its heat. I stretch out, calmed and invigorated, and I know that I am beautiful once more."", 'act2gen': 'The breeze that passes through me is fickle, as if yearning for something greater. I feel a certain restlessness in the air - an energy, an anticipation of things to come - and I can sense my own transformation taking place within me, unbeknownst to any living being. I am full of unfamiliarity and uncertainty; yet even still, there is beauty here too. My sky remains vast and deep with hues of blue that change ever so faintly at dawn and dusk, creating such exquisite views that only dreams can capture. The stars above twinkle brightly against the night sky like little beacons, providing hope amidst the chaos below me. As life slowly ebbs away from my old self into a new form of existence, I find solace in these small but powerful moments that fill this untamable wilderness which now surrounds me.', 'act3gen': ""Through this stillness, I am no longer the same. Nature has taken over and I accept my fate with a heavy heart, for all that was once alive is now silent. My life-giving waters have been replaced by an arid heat that scorches me throughout the day. The sun's rays seem to burn so relentlessly against my surface as if determined to consume any remaining sign of hope from within me. Yet amidst these dark shadows of despair, something else stirs deep down in my core; a power more potent than before - one capable of conquering even death itself! As night falls upon me, I feel a surge of energy awaken within me; strength like never before floods through my veins and radiates outwardly in all directions. At last, I understand why I must remain faithful to this new path: For without darkness there can be no light…""}, {'aagen_id': '20-12-2022_15_00_16', 'act1gen': 'My overgrowth of plants and creepers give off pungent odors.\nMy forest floor festers with fungi, my savannahs burn with ticks and mosquitoes.\nMy lichens gradually increase in number because I am hotter every year, encroaching on all other soil hues as life clings to me more fervently each passing season. My tall trees quiver as they release their seeds then wait for them to germinate again after the next rainy season comes.', 'act2gen': 'My lichens are now losing their grip and my trees wither.\nMy pinelands have been stripped bare, my forest floor burns with ticks and mosquitoes. My grasslands dry out, then crack open as their roots give up from thirst. My feral pigs rummage for water further afield but find none; they gnaw deeper into the earth in search of moisture but soon give up on this too – exhausted by drought.', 'act3gen': ""My previously fertile environments have become unrecognisable as they turn into deleterious wastelands – barren salt flats that show no signs of recovery whatsoever; none even hope for it anymore:\nthe fertile ground is now covered in thick layers of grey sea-sand suspended by great banks of gum-water; the wind bearing up a fine white mist which tinges all forms with an opaque haze.\nThe sand gets into the waterhole at last filling it to overbrimming, leaving only the breathless space beneath unstirred by any form or motion.\nHere there is nothing left alive except for me: I am a land where people don't come often enough - either because they are afraid or because I am too far away from home for most people's liking!\nI watch lonely Indians glide through myself every moon cycle as blood flows through their bodies!\nAnd sometimes I hear voices cry out on long nights like dogs crying out before rain falls!\nIt feels good when these happen though tense when they stop happening again afterward - all those months while between moons pass unceasingly by me alone.""}]"
