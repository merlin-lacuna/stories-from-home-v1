# stories-from-home-v1

Repository for the data and code for the "Stories from Home" art project.

## Data Guidelines

When commiting data make sure that the file meets the following criteria.

. The file is in CSV format.

. The name follows the format "<element>_<entity>_<measurement>_<location_name>.csv" â€” e.g "fire_forestfire_nvdi_mendocino.csv"

. For the <entity>_<measurement> combination, make sure that there is a matching story template in the [Story Templates file](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ppMOdtHwWckeUYHZIU_a8FEKzK9PkKGkz_7ZyAikNjg/edit#gid=310651524)
  * If there's no matching story template, request one in the Stories from Home WhatsApp group.

. The column that stores the time period should always be called "*Time*".

. The column that stores the measurement should always be called "*Data*".

. There should be no empty spaces around the column title "e.g. "Time,Data" not " Time , Data"

. The time format should always be YYY-MM-DD, even if it's monthly or yearly.
  * If years, add january of each year like this "2020-01-01, 2021-01-01, 2022-01-01"
  * If months, add the first of each month like this: "2021-01-01, 2021-02-01, 2021-03-01"
  * Don't worry if the data did not fall on that precise date, it will be aggregated.

. After you've commited the data file, add an corresponding entry to the [Metadata CSV](https://github.com/merlin-lacuna/stories-from-home-v1/blob/main/data/metadata.csv) file and commit the updated metadata file as well.
