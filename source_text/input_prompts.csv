desert_airtemp,The desert is bone dry and experiencing unprecedented heat. Anything has previously survived its climate is now dead.,"The desert is feeling more fragmented than ever, each of its grains of sand, every fine debris of its former self are burning, now disjointed from the unity of its mass. A state of irreversible disintegration has just started.",The desert is extremely dry and there is barely any moisture for organisms to survive.,"The drought of the desert is no longer its vital condition, as it no more seems to originate from its very essence, but rather due to unknown and destructive external forces impossible to placate.",The desert is drier than it usually is and its ecosystem is beginning to struggle.,"All the granules of sand seem to vanish, and the desert is now confronted with a hopeless state of inability to react. It no more has full control of the constituents that used to form its body and spirit. All crumbles and pales under a merciless sun.",The desert is not experiencing anything out of the ordinary. It is dry but not unusually so. It supports a thriving ecosystem.,"The desert nevertheless realises that the sun has always been his constant companion, his guidance, his star and his faith. Perhaps it should once again trust the rays that stroke its sandy surface, however brutally.",The desert is unusually moist and lush. It is beginning to attract organisms that do not usually thrive in the desert.,"The desert experiences the encounter with an nearly alien element, or at least detects its influence. The aura of water permeates its surface and the humidity gives a glimpse of new horizons, altering its inner landscape."

forest_lai,The forest has lost more leaves than it has ever lost before in its lifetime.,"The forest realizes that the earth is cravingly swallowing its essence and it moans to the wind caressing its branches if from its dissipation will rise a fertile micro-universe, or if its collapse will lead only to sterile hopes.",The forest has lost a dramatically high proportion of its leaves and greenery.,"The forest notices that all the living parts that once composed its abundance are dropping to the ground, victims of an ineluctable and merciless force of gravity.",The forest can't seem to stop losing leaves.,"The forest floats in between questions with no answers, wondering to the sky, to the clouds, to the grass if they witnessed anything it failed to see.",The forest has a healthy amount of leaves.,The forest is flooded with the sage stream of lymph.

glacier_ndsi,The glacier has lost more ice and mass than it has ever lost before in its lifetime.,"The glacier moans, a howl emanating from the very nucleus of the universe.

It feels in anguish, torn whether to surrender to the melting or endure.",The glacier is starting to shink and lose ice mass.,"The glacier is seized by a new state breaking through the silence of its environment. It lets itself go by abandoning itself to this inner transformation, which seems to become increasingly evident in its external appearance as well.",The glacier has a stable ice mass.,The glacier is intimately connected with the whole extension that constitutes its being. The freezing solidity of its kind is like a harmonious melody that vibrates on the notes of balance and radiance.,The glacier seems to keep increasing in ice mass and getting bigger.,"The glacier fully intermingles with the exterior, allowing itself to be exposed to the kind surrounding atmosphere and to be modified by the power of life itself.

Some regions even benefit from more water.,The island is bound to notice its slow metamorphosis. From within it is branching out and impacting its semblance.

volcano_temp,"The volcano is errupting, destroying neighbouring forest and blocking out the sun.","The volcano cant avoid its inescapable fate, its destiny is that of crawling out from the earth that mourns, groans in a wail of despair.
