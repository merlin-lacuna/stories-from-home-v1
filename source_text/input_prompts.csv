Some regions even benefit from more water.,The island is bound to notice its slow metamorphosis. From within it is branching out and impacting its semblance.

volcano_temp,"The volcano is errupting, destroying neighbouring forest and blocking out the sun.","The volcano can’t avoid its inescapable fate, its destiny is that of crawling out from the earth that mourns, groans in a wail of despair.

land_c02,"The c02 levels in the air above the land is at dire, extreme levels. The carbon dioxide is causing suffocating greenhouse effects, smothering the land with oppressive heat.","The CO2 springs with an implacable crescendo. Its load swells incautiously.

water_cover,The lake has lost more of its former water level than it has ever lost before in its lifetime.,"The lake barely sways, its ripples of water become less and less frequent, and the abyss of its bottom is surfacing more and more.
