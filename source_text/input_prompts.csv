100,Practical Description,The desert is bone dry and experiencing unprecedented heat. Anything has previously survived its climate is now dead.,The forest has lost more leaves than it has ever lost before in its lifetime.,The glacier has lost more ice and mass than it has ever lost before in its lifetime.,The island has lost more surface area than it has ever lost before in its lifetime. It is about to vanish.,The ocean has increased in volume to sea levels never seen before in its lifetime. It is devouring everything in its path.,The land has lost more flora and fauna than it has ever lost before in its lifetime. It is on the verge of becoming devoid of any flora and fauna whatsoever.,"The volcano is errupting, destroying neighbouring forest and blocking out the sun.",The forest has been severely burned. Forest fires have consumed a huge chunk of the forest,The land's rainfall is extremely high. The precipitation is at unprecedented levels.,"The c02 levels in the air above the land is at dire, extreme levels. The carbon dioxide is causing suffocating greenhouse effects, smothering the land with oppressive heat.",The land has never seen such a lack of snow in winter before in its lifetime. It is dry and naked.,The lake has lost more of its former water level than it has ever lost before in its lifetime.
150,Short Synopsis,"The desert is feeling more fragmented than ever, each of its grains of sand, every fine debris of its former self are burning, now disjointed from the unity of its mass. A state of irreversible disintegration has just started.","The forest realizes that the earth is cravingly swallowing its essence and it moans to the wind caressing its branches if from its dissipation will rise a fertile micro-universe, or if its collapse will lead only to sterile hopes.","The glacier moans, a howl emanating from the very nucleus of the universe. It feels dazed by the idea that maybe only this sound, its own voice, will be all that remains once it's dissolved its state of being may no longer be the same as it used to be.",The island perceives that its substance is fading and it appears to be dissipating under the ruthless touch of its hungry surroundings. Its scope is shrinking and the threat of disappearance hovers all over. The island fears the irreversibility of time and matter.,"The ocean feels in the midst of desperation and disenchantment because it is dismissed from its status, and merely replaced by high tides that do not lend solace and aim to demean.","The land finds itself deprived of its vivid lovers and blooming companions. Sterility now appears to be its ultimate destination, and all around reigns a silence with mortiferous overtones. The condition of absence casts a shadow of despair on its entire extension.","The volcano canâ€™t avoid its inescapable fate, its destiny is that of crawling out from the earth that mourns, groans in a wail of despair. It is called to break away from its primal origin, and is left within an abyssal turmoil.","The forest experiences that all around unknown sharp entities of almost liquid heat are ruthlessly surging forward, dispossessing its presence and dismantling its vital force with their consistency. They are flames rising unannounced from the soil and besieging inexorably the branches, putting the flowing lymph into a blaze of pure destruction.","The land is no further capable of embracing, sustaining and shoring up its surroundings. Everything is fractured, brittle and in a precarious state of disarray. The process of displacement and disconnection from the world appears imminent while fragility abounds.","The CO2 springs with an implacable crescendo. Its load swells incautiously. It's the burden of the cosmos itself. Everything around stagnates in stasis. A grey, stifling density pervades the entire land's atmosphere, decking everything exists on its way. An airy wave of faded hopes is ruling.","The land no longer has any snow strata gracing and encircling it body. The whiteness that once emanated luminescence is now merely a nostalgic reminiscence of a bygone era that seems to have never occurred. Winter is not anymore a season, but rather a dream of melted crystal.","The lake barely sways, its ripples of water become less and less frequent, and the abyss of its bottom is surfacing more and more. Parched stones exposed to the sky take the space of formerly generous waters. The lake is turning into a disenchanted puddle."
200,Practical Description,The desert is extremely dry and there is barely any moisture for organisms to survive.,The forest has lost a dramatically high proportion of its leaves and greenery.,The glacier has lost a dramatically high proportion of its ice mass.,The island has lost a dramatically high proportion of its surface area and coastline.,The ocean is reaching dramatically high sea levels which is triggering unforeseen side effects in surrounding regions.,The land is losing dramatically high levels of flora and fauna which is triggering unforeseen side effects in surrounding regions and destroying the ecosystem.,The volcano is getting very hot and emmiting noxious gasses.,The forest has barely started to recover from a disastrous forest fire.,,The c02 in the air above the land is at unprecented levels. There is far too much carbon dioxide in the air and the ecosystem of the land suffering significantly with the effects of the greenhouse gasses talking hold.,"The land is noticing a dramatically high reduction of snowfall, barely being coated in snow at all.",The lake has lost a dramatically high proportion of its former water level.
250,Short Synopsis,"The drought of the desert is no longer its vital condition, as it no more seems to originate from its very essence, but rather due to unknown and destructive external forces impossible to placate.","The forest notices that all the living parts that once composed its abundance are dropping to the ground, victims of an ineluctable and merciless force of gravity.","The glacier notices that its limbs become looser and creaks become more and more hearable, as if its body is growing fractures and each particle of ice is groaning . It feels in anguish, torn whether to surrender to the melting or endure.","The habitat that once embraced the island now inexorably encircles it, attempting to suppress, drown and engulf it. It looks like an unannounced assault, and the island from being a gem becomes a relict of a doomed present.","The ocean notices that its entire body is at the mercy of intense compulsions and convulsions, as if an unnamed entity is just draining its energy from its own womb.",The land is confronted with a grave sense of responsibility towards anything it penetrates with its presence. Everything it touches aches and cries for the loss of vital spirit. It seems there is only stillness left.,The volcano's limbs are imprisoned in between uncorruptible rocky concretions. It experiences a reckless drive to turn its surroundings into utmost chaos. The magmatic outburst will cast a new path.,"The forest senses that its leaves are suffocating, surrounded by a thick, opaque haze. The fume mantle is apparently bent on no longer allowing the sunlight to reach the forest's previously lush extensions. Everything grows fuzzy, the trunks creak at the dawn of an impending end.","The moisture through which the land once breathed and on which it feasted evaporates. Like a spirit doomed not to stay, the aura of wetness departs. Aridity and frailty take its stead as the skies can no longer offer their drops of life.","A process of asphyxiation is now advancing, sparing no single breathing entity. The purity of the earth is tainted; the CO2 performs like the greaser of a plague coming from the Infinte. No longer can anything filter out the blazing sun's force, which is ceaselessly consuming lives.","The land stares longingly and famished at the skies waiting for snowflakes to descend on its surface to mingle with its essence, and so become one. Expectation is consuming, and only tiny crystals carried by remote gusts passively fluctuate over it.","The lake fails to hold its waters in place; the once floridly slimy bed is gradually dehydrating, causing the lake vegetation to shrink. Animals are not guzzling anymore through its depths and the mesmerizing gloom of the waters is less and less intense."
300,Practical Description,The desert is drier than it usually is and its ecosystem is beginning to struggle.,The forest can't seem to stop losing leaves.,The glacier is starting to shink and lose ice mass.,The island is starting to shrink and decrease in surface area.,The ocean is experiencing erratic sea levels which are make it difficult for surrounding regions to adapt to its unusual fluctuations.,The flora and fauna of the land is are slowly withering and dying and the ecosystem is becoming very unstable.,The volcano is starting to get hot and cracks begin to form near the crater.,The forest is very fragile. It is now growing new roots after a devastating forest fire.,,The c02 in the air above the land is at worrying levels. There is too much carbon dioxide in the air and the ecosystem of the land is beginning to suffer.,The land is starting to notice a significant reduction in snowfall during winter.,The lake is starting to shrink and its water level is getting lower.
350,Short Synopsis,"All the granules of sand seem to vanish, and the desert is now confronted with a hopeless state of inability to react. It no more has full control of the constituents that used to form its body and spirit. All crumbles and pales under a merciless sun.","The forest floats in between questions with no answers, wondering to the sky, to the clouds, to the grass if they witnessed anything it failed to see.","The glacier is seized by a new state breaking through the silence of its environment. It lets itself go by abandoning itself to this inner transformation, which seems to become increasingly evident in its external appearance as well.","The island is feeling debilitated. After an initial bewilderment, it catches sight of itself reflected in the water and notices that its shape has changed, its boundaries have shifted by moving closer and closer towards its center. The island is significantly more vulnerable to the outside influences, and this drains its energy and self awarness.","The  ocean realises that the brilliance of its surface acts now like traversed by flimsy and unruly flashes, the water dances are not rhythmical anymore but almost hiccupping, and the foam looks like the effect of malaise, emesis and no longer seminal essence.",The absence of copmanion-elements is now creating turbulent influences on the land that is no longer in complete command of itself. Unforeseen and unknown phenomena now regulate its rhythm and existence. It is a totally unfathomable universe and nothing seems to be cyclical anymore.,The facets of this world will be veined with streams of red tears stemming from the volcano. The earth melts in its cracks. It savagely reveals the bones of the universe. From the nucleus of the globe flames become liquid.,"The forest crumbles towards the formerly moist and fecund terrain. Shreds of ash flicker in the air, making the atmosphere dense with dashed hopes and fading memories. Dreariness has replaced the living spirits, casting its shadow of silence all over the space.","The land slowly becomes opaque. Once it was possible to detect sheets of water through which a portion of the universe was mirroring itself. Now the reflections of the heaven are shrinking. All around, life's impetus faces a crash, and the land stumbles into dehydration.","The breezy rhythm at which the clouds used to dance appears to be muted. A colourless omen looms, like a shadow from which absolutely nothing can evade. The land is getting darker under this threat. The C02 is keeping the environment under siege, poised to make its graceful vigor perish.","The land is transforming indistinctly. The dense candid sheet enveloping the land evenly has now morphed into faint, loose patches of faded whiteness constellating its mass dimly. The snow is not lively like a cloud, but becomes substance increasingly akin to water.","The lake's basin fades slowly away through an augmented evaporation. Ephemerality is the substitute of balance. And the breeze is unable to generate rhyclical waves. Only fragile glimmers of light now caress the water body. All around, the nostalgic shores are left only half-wet.

400,Practical Description,The desert is not experiencing anything out of the ordinary. It is dry but not unusually so. It supports a thriving ecosystem.,The forest has a healthy amount of leaves.,The glacier has a stable ice mass.,The island is losing small parts of its coastline but these changes are slow enough for surrounding regions of adapt. Some regions even benefit from more water.,The ocean is experiencing higher than normal sea levels but these increases are slow enough for surrounding regions of adapt. Some regions even benefit from more water.,The land's ecoystem is slowly deteriorating but the flora and fauna of the land are adapting to these changes.,"The volcano is tepid and and harmless, only small amounts of steam are released.",The forest is making surprisingly fast progress in regrowing vegetation after a destructive forest fire.,The land's rainfall is starting to become a little high.,"The c02 in the air above the land is at tolerable levels. Although there is more carbon dioxide in the air, the ecosystem of the land is still coping well.","The lands winter-time snowfall is a little less than normal, but nothing to be too worried about yet.",The lake has a stable water level.
450,Short Synopsis,"The desert nevertheless realises that the sun has always been his constant companion, his guidance, his star and his faith. Perhaps it should once again trust the rays that stroke its sandy surface, however brutally.",The forest is flooded with the sage stream of lymph. All the extremities are reached by this vital essence and quiver with vivacity while letting themselves be graced by the sky.,The glacier is intimately connected with the whole extension that constitutes its being. The freezing solidity of its kind is like a harmonious melody that vibrates on the notes of balance and radiance.,The island is bound to notice its slow metamorphosis. From within it is branching out and impacting its semblance. It comes to recognise that it is senseless to inhibit this process of transformation as certain strands of its existence apparently begin to incorporate the transition by transcending the fear of the unknown. The island is prone to the future.,"The ocean experiences that the currents are more copious than its capacity for thirst. These flow through it and cause its essence to overflow, yet gently. None of these motions lead to stifling, but rather reflects the incommensurable potency of water.",The land gradually realises that it has not been forsaken. Whatever once swayed and breathed with her emerges again after a period of meditative and painful conversion. The force of adaptability seems to arise anew from every segment of its surface like an epiphany from the unknown.,A new form of existence might spring again from the volcano vibrancy. Threads made of gentle warmth unfold from its core. The volcano languidly dissolves in the presence of a glowing new beginning. After decades of quiescence its soul is released.,"The forest barely exists. All seems gradually to fall back to a primordial slumber. The forest, after the wildness of a cosmic intrusion, has exhaled its last sigh, willing to rest in stasis. The final bursts animate the leftovers of the bushes, faintly illuminating the remants of an earlier existence.","The land can sense that its energies are ebbing and fading. It cares to conserve its watery reservoirs by secretly guarding moisture particles in the shadows, as if they were perishing cosmic gems. A transition is underway and the land stands in a liminal state.",Equilibrium is offering a bright pace to the land. This represents the highest aim to which all the eras yearn. Balance's oscillation is a brittle and alluring condition. The CO2 acts in synergy with the organisms that enliven the land; each creature is attuned to its own inner states. The whole energy on the globe is geared and activated to react to the anomalies with a generating spirit.,"The land gets slightly exposed as there seem to be a few narrow slices of the sky not inclined to encourage snowfall. However, its surface shines radiant - the sun makes all the fine ice shards shaping its landscapes glow. The land brings winter to life.","The lake is a freshwater mirror in which the landscape reflects, bringing to life a blissful doubling of the surroundings. Its waters undulate harmoniously, hitting the rocky contours perpetually on the same spots. The water's voice resonates like a healing chant."
500,Practical Description,The desert is unusually moist and lush. It is beginning to attract organisms that do not usually thrive in the desert.,The forest seems to keep growing more and more leaves and leaf cover is increasing.,The glacier seems to keep increasing in ice mass and getting bigger.,The island has a stable surface area which is in harmony with its internal ecosystem.,The ocean is experiencing stable sea levels which are in harmony with its surroundings.,The land has a stable ecoystem which is nurturing a flourishing variety of flora and fauna.,The volcano is dormant and stable. It nurtures a rich ecosystem.,The forest is doing fine. The burned sections have been absorbed into the soil and act as fertilizer for the burgeoning new tree roots.,The land's rainfall has returned to normal levels,The c02 in the air above the land is at very heathly levels. The healthy balance of carbon dioxide and oxygen is allowing the ecoystem of the land to function is it should.,"The land is blanketed with a thick layer of snowfall during winter, just like every winter.",The lake's water level seems to keep increasing and getting higher.
550,Short Synopsis,"The desert experiences the encounter with an nearly alien element, or at least detects its influence. The aura of water permeates its surface and the humidity gives a glimpse of new horizons, altering its inner landscape.","The forest becomes pure rebirth by embracing a luminous unstoppable process of growth that imbues every leaf, root, branch, sprout. Everything around evolves, shines and is fortified. The forest is an ode to life.","The glacier fully intermingles with the exterior, allowing itself to be exposed to the kind surrounding atmosphere and to be modified by the power of life itself. Its volume is majestic and sublime, immeasurable in its crystalline stasis.","The island senses itself as a privileged reality, touched on all its sides by a world in perpetual flux. Everything influences it, and yet its identity flares magnificently, as an entity to be protected and revered, a rarity in the cosmos that enshrines a finite but precious ecosystem.","The ocean is a harmonious universe. All sways in endless motion but always following a stream of effortless dynamism. The line of the horizon is a trustworthy eternal archetype, and the ocean honours it by not crossing its shimmering edge.",The land is a hybrid of elements and states. The greatness of its condition lies in the fine balance that brings different spheres of existence into alignment and interplay. Reciprocal contamination is the prevailing wealth that holds its different components in constant coexistence.,The volcano is fully alive and turns into a blazing source of destructive renewal. Its blistering lymph sprouts incautious from the very core of the earth. It bursts into lava to merge with the soil and fulfill its crave for freedom.,"The forest is reduced to the mere surfacing of its roots. The earth's desiccation has supplanted the luxurious ecosystem of organisms originally in harmony. All turns into stillness, and the forest whispers in the breeze its generous legacy to the universe, wishing to bloom anew.","The land is elastic and smooth, it resonates with harmonious resilience to both outward and inward impulses. It is apt to cradle and nurture its encircling landscapes. The soil shaping its presence is salubrious and bursting with scintillating strength. The humidity gives birth to iridescent veins within the terrain.","The CO2 fluctuates as keeper and protector of the Earth's well-being; its regulations make the land and the skies embracing its mass breathe in unison, letting even the most impervious places pulsate with pleasure and delight. Everything streams seamlessly, engendering a cycle of universal euphony.","The land breathes following the rhythm of the falling snowflakes. A muffled atmosphere unfolds all around, and winter blazes in all its white energy. The cyclicality of the seasons is preserved, and the land manifests itself as a pall of albino light.","The lake welcomed alien waters into its existence, and its mass grew profusely through a fervid absorbsion. The previously clearly defined banks are being gently exceeded, and the water dances out of its lushness."
