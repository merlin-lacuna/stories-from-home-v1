forest_lai,The forest has lost more leaves than it has ever lost before in its lifetime.,"The forest realizes that the earth is cravingly swallowing its essence and it moans to the wind caressing its branches if from its dissipation will rise a fertile micro-universe, or if its collapse will lead only to sterile hopes.",The forest has lost a dramatically high proportion of its leaves and greenery.,"The forest notices that all the living parts that once composed its abundance are dropping to the ground, victims of an ineluctable and merciless force of gravity.",The forest can't seem to stop losing leaves.,"The forest floats in between questions with no answers, wondering to the sky, to the clouds, to the grass if they witnessed anything it failed to see.",The forest has a healthy amount of leaves.,The forest is flooded with the sage stream of lymph.

glacier_mass,The glacier has lost more ice and mass than it has ever lost before in its lifetime.,"The glacier moans, a howl emanating from the very nucleus of the universe.

It feels in anguish, torn whether to surrender to the melting or endure.",The glacier is starting to shink and lose ice mass.,"The glacier is seized by a new state breaking through the silence of its environment. It lets itself go by abandoning itself to this inner transformation, which seems to become increasingly evident in its external appearance as well.",The glacier has a stable ice mass.,The glacier is intimately connected with the whole extension that constitutes its being.

Its volume is majestic and sublime, immeasurable in its crystalline stasis."
island_area,The island has lost more surface area than it has ever lost before in its lifetime.

Its scope is shrinking and the threat of disappearance hovers all over. The island fears the irreversibility of time and matter.,The island has lost a dramatically high proportion of its surface area and coastline.,"The habitat that once embraced the island now inexorably encircles it, attempting to suppress, drown and engulf it.

After an initial bewilderment, it catches sight of itself reflected in the water and notices that its shape has changed, its boundaries have shifted by moving closer and closer towards its center. The island is significantly more vulnerable to the outside influences, and this drains its energy and self awarness.",The island is losing small parts of its coastline but these changes are slow enough for surrounding regions of adapt. Some regions even benefit from more water.,The island is bound to notice its slow metamorphosis. From within it is branching out and impacting its semblance. It comes to recognise that it is senseless to inhibit this process of transformation as certain strands of its existence apparently begin to incorporate the transition by transcending the fear of the unknown. The island is prone to the future.,The island has a stable surface area which is in harmony with its internal ecosystem.,"The island senses itself as a privileged reality, touched on all its sides by a world in perpetual flux. Everything influences it, and yet its identity flares magnificently, as an entity to be protected and revered, a rarity in the cosmos that enshrines a finite but precious ecosystem."

Some regions even benefit from more water.,"The ocean experiences that the currents are more copious than its capacity for thirst. These flow through it and cause its essence to overflow, yet gently. None of these motions lead to stifling, but rather reflects the incommensurable potency of water.",The ocean is experiencing stable sea levels which are in harmony with its surroundings.,"The ocean is a harmonious universe. All sways in endless motion but always following a stream of effortless dynamism.

volcano_temp,"The volcano is errupting, destroying neighbouring forest and blocking out the sun.","The volcano can’t avoid its inescapable fate, its destiny is that of crawling out from the earth that mourns, groans in a wail of despair.

forest_wildfire,The forest has been severely burned. Forest fires have consumed a huge chunk of the forest,"The forest experiences that all around unknown sharp entities of almost liquid heat are ruthlessly surging forward, dispossessing its presence and dismantling its vital force with their consistency.

land_precip,The land's rainfall is extremely high. The precipitation is at unprecedented levels. ,"The land is no further capable of embracing, sustaining and shoring up its surroundings.

The humidity gives birth to iridescent veins within the terrain."
land_c02,"The c02 levels in the air above the land is at dire, extreme levels. The carbon dioxide is causing suffocating greenhouse effects, smothering the land with oppressive heat.","The CO2 springs with an implacable crescendo. Its load swells incautiously. It's the burden of the cosmos itself. Everything around stagnates in stasis. A grey, stifling density pervades the entire land's atmosphere, decking everything exists on its way. An airy wave of faded hopes is ruling.",The c02 in the air above the land is at unprecented levels. There is far too much carbon dioxide in the air and the ecosystem of the land suffering significantly with the effects of the greenhouse gasses talking hold.,"A process of asphyxiation is now advancing, sparing no single breathing entity. The purity of the earth is tainted; the CO2 performs like the greaser of a plague coming from the Infinte. No longer can anything filter out the blazing sun's force, which is ceaselessly consuming lives. ",The c02 in the air above the land is at worrying levels.

Although there is more carbon dioxide in the air, the ecosystem of the land is still coping well.",Equilibrium is offering a bright pace to the land. This represents the highest aim to which all the eras yearn. Balance's oscillation is a brittle and alluring condition. The CO2 acts in synergy with the organisms that enliven the land; each creature is attuned to its own inner states. The whole energy on the globe is geared and activated to react to the anomalies with a generating spirit.,The c02 in the air above the land is at very heathly levels. The healthy balance of carbon dioxide and oxygen is allowing the ecoystem of the land to function is it should. ,"The CO2 fluctuates as keeper and protector of the Earth's well-being; its regulations make the land and the skies embracing its mass breathe in unison, letting even the most impervious places pulsate with pleasure and delight. Everything streams seamlessly, engendering a cycle of universal euphony."
