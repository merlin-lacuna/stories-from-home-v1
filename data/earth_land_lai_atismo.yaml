  bio: I am a vast and sandy tract of forest. Some of my trees are dry and deciduous
    and others are spiny. My climate is hot and sweaty, but very occasionally, I become
    tropical and sultry
  descriptor: vast and sandy
  element: earth

  measurementdescr: leaf cover
  type: forest
prompt:
  act0descr: 'ACT0: The forest''s leaf cover is not yet known. The forest introduces
    itself and describes its surroundings.\nFOREST:'
  act1descr: 'ACT1: The forest seems to keep growing more and more leaves and leaf
    cover is increasing. The forest becomes pure rebirth by embracing a luminous unstoppable
    process of growth that imbues every leaf, root, branch, sprout. Everything around
    evolves, shines and is fortified. The forest is an ode to life.\nFOREST:'
  act2descr: 'ACT2: The forest has a healthy amount of leaves. The forest is flooded
    with the sage stream of lymph. All the extremities are reached by this vital essence
    and quiver with vivacity while letting themselves be graced by the sky.\nFOREST:'
  act3descr: 'ACT3: The forest can''t seem to stop losing leaves. The forest floats
    in between questions with no answers, wondering to the sky, to the clouds, to
    the grass if they witnessed anything it failed to see.\nFOREST:'
  intro: The following play reveals the inner monologue of a lush and pensive forest.
    It is divided into several acts. Throughout these acts, the forest describes its
    inner and outer transformation:\n\nThe first act starts like this:\n\n

  act1gen: "To be alive is to be surrounded by mill-smelling humidity, it's the scent
    of living that rises and fills me up when I'm all nibbled away by the dark. \nAUTUMN:
    I just come at the right time! HE'S LIGHTED A FIRE IN MY BONES ANDI AM NO LONGER
    ALONE! I am beautiful because he makes me burn each so~ng ends exactly as if it
    were beginning (inside), each hour finds its place (in its turn).\nFOREST:To live
    IS to watch water in a leafless thicket where only dead thistles that haven't
    seen completely are waiting for their lives whole year round. Hear them moan;
    life is active around here The death cycle reaches maturity, its esse is l'être
    [to b e]: seeds germinate, putrefaction takes root : \"nature has triumphed over
    humanity:' . . .. Certainly not! Sunrays penetrate my canopy and imbue with birth
    every germ put into hibernation underfoot Midnight sings In this cave smelling
    of springtime you cut off head from wounded tree Heavy leaves fall on your nape
    - some catch in your hair - Their breath mixed with sunlit leaves Isn't actually
    bacterial rot related to pure respiration? Come out onto land fertilized by nothing
    but st illness Breath tells you how Nothing unburdens care It will finish us off
    or hurtle through ! ..."
  act2gen: "To live IS to trust your feet in the soft mosses of the dampening forest,
    it's communicating by firmer sprouts everything resinous you thus learn that immunity
    comes before leaves. \nSHADE:I bring you dreams with my milky loam You are nourished
    by depths and experience me as leaden Your nightmares are astringent Drunk on
    thick night where I sift out from myself spores floating Come onto darkened track
    trampled by rustling cicadas Shivers race over empty spaces ...\nFOREST:To be
    linked is for a-corpuscle-rich brain to radiate its flesh beyond a vast tree courting
    powerlessness - daylight has not yet reached here The stems groan and struggle
    their boles live democratically their bodies strive toward unity. .. yes granted
    Were there no fierce suns we'd dream relentlessly among our spreading arms legs
    veins roots This thirst itself is exalting!"
  act3gen: 'What we did while living is, perhaps, impossible not to weep over.

    WINTER: Nothing exists outside the frosted time of roots! Here I was dead for
    a long lime - Lacking sap no heart could expand why live black?'

  act1gen: "Before I had leaves, and others grew them for me at their own expense.
    One has to pay dearly for the privilege of being green.\nUnless we are speaking
    about palms or eucalyptus, in which case one must be blue ... \nWould that other
    forests might have leaves enoug h for us all!\nthe earth turned around herself
    a little faster ...\nYes, in another life I should like my trunk to be yellow-skinned;
    my crown and my roots red; my bark keratinous; crushed with ease by the fingernail
    and sweat-proof when worn on the body ... \nnIn Djahan we were deep purple and
    tenacious rubber trees. To you inhabited lands we were balsa: their sap divinely
    lightened our load - so that they could bear you too! Dark rocks will not carry
    water? Their turn hasn't come yet: they want only rockier lands than mine.[11]
    The denouement approaches: \"\\201839 is perhaps already abolished here where
    this forest grows right up to La Jonchère peak."
  act2gen: "Absence of shadow. I don't know how to produce it.\nThe only one among
    us who knows how is the thorn tree. He uproots himself and goes beyond our domain;
    a dry star, white mangrove or rare agarwood, he lives far from here: stripped
    of bark near rivers, where fire with its cracklings lights him up! ... \nn\nEmbedded
    in time like this telegraphy-pole forest which doesn't even have sufficient staves
    to shore itself up against drought and might topple at any moment when the termites
    arrive! ... And with what emotion would these columns drink ca tarrh by lifting
    themselves off their roots betimes so as not to deprive me any longer of my lymphoid
    ichor? ... Oh transplantable trees!: dislocated after being blindfolded and called
    on suddenly to adopt th e costume and wear it for hajra on arrival! Yes: transferred
    without knowing whither - each particle remaining fixed in place - because sky
    does not reach them completely but leaves are gashed from over there just as yaws
    attack wanderers; you move together your children away from famine (sic) . . .\nAnd
    leprosy here's drowning you too busy toppling your healthy wood that drinks lime
    less greedily than we do, bleeding pustules into laurel bilis which will quench
    all thirst for calcareous species since we'll be seated under your seal forever!
    ..."
  act3gen: 'How much deeper the river into which I wanted to fall! Th at''s why, calcinated
    amongst my brothers who are on fire - our roots intertwined, disneylanded, soulless
    and even stumps ever thirsty for wood dissolved in urine of nla Amazônia where
    we all escaped together through yaws gnawing one whole healthy root so tha t sleepless

  act1gen: 'I am a vast and tropical tract of forest. Some of my trees are dry and
    deciduous, others are spiny, there are flowers in my garden ... this is what I
    look like: each of the tiny blossoms that dance around me has a million sparkling
    filaments that catch fire when I weave them into strings for necklaces! Flowers
    sprout from every tree trunk - it''s raining stars !'
  act2gen: Look at me!
  act3gen: 'Who is there in my barren woods? With whom do I speak?

    There, there at the top of my trunk! A toad! A black big-eyed toad. He listened
    and then disappeared into a little crack.

  act1gen: I am wet and dense, I moult my shadows in the soil. I hear fragments of
    sound approaching me but they are dislocated.
  act2gen: 'I am an aquatic and heavy forest. I drip with organic essences also needed
    by certain forms of vegetation which, not harvesting the sky''s rays


    I am fragrant, sulphurous. (Here a dew appears.) Not harvesting? The limbs realize
    they are passive toward the sky and its clear womb sends them daily doses of sugar-morning-gold,
    begets their yellow morning skullcaps! ... Storms awake! ...'
  act3gen: "Gleams escaped while I was sleeping. Why did they not smother me? ...
    How many awakening flashes could I have caught in the night if my nap had been
    longer, deep! ... Why do leaves maturing around us still seem so sparse?\nThere's
    a bitter cry: DECAY IS NEARBY! ... that penetrates through my dense flesh and
    annihilates everything a priori as foundation of sediments which were to gather
    around it. \nDecay is nearby. (This decay appears.) Dirt rots secretively behind
    our backs so we can't see it; eyes rummage unsecuredly only because hands haven't
    yet rooted out their sight lumps from beyond viewways."

  act1gen: I grew dark green leaves. I hung thick and tightly over every path, blocking
    all access to me.
  act2gen: 'I push down my branches and lift up my leaves: how good is the sky! How
    much strength it gives to a tree!'
  act3gen: 'I spread nothing but green and here, on my branches, all the sap rots.
    I held them out to you at dawn ... nothing happened! The sky never answered me
    \:1 did not know the most important thing in life.



    The voice of this forest is that of sensation; it forbids passive contemplation.
    There passes something similar ta a monologue by Robbe-Grillet in his novella,
    Un m Chrome plays with their anguish over large sunken boles, which pass during
    attempts to travel as far into "total realism" as possible brief shout that inspires
    one with loss: "Life could not exhaust itself separated from death while they
    understood so perfectly each other.''· In Carson MacCullers'' forests there are

  act1gen: 'Many times I have been covered with leaves; many times I wrap my feet
    in grasses and jump over them. The ocean of the world kisses me beyond all that
    it has to give, but you, who are resisting its gravity, say nothing and bare your
    ankles before these endless mosses which moisten me and enliven me.

    Do not know our contact: it is hidden:

    Most beautiful among flowers! It whistles little against the watering can. 1 proceed

    on man's flanks. ...

    mark emptiness? Colleagues of man: All around the immense that-will-not lasts
    for a long time:
