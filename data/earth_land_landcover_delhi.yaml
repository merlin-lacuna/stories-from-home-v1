entitydescr:
  bio: My domain is a tropical savanna climate. Every year, I am drenched by monsoons.
    I am hot and humid which means vegetation grows abundantly all over me, with various
    thorny bushes and trees. Sometimes I experience a "heat island" effect where the
    combination of heat and humidity results in a greater amount of heat being stored
    in urban areas, which makes it hotter at nighttime.
  descriptor: a hot and humid land

prompt:
  act0descr: 'ACT0: The urban land cover is not yet known. The land introduces itself
    and describes its surroundings.\nLAND: '
  act1descr: 'ACT1: The flora and fauna of the land is are slowly withering and dying
    and the ecosystem is becoming very unstable. The absence of companion-elements
    is now creating turbulent influences on the land that is no longer in complete
    command of itself. Unforeseen and unknown phenomena now regulate its rhythm and
    existence. It is a totally unfathomable universe and nothing seems to be cyclical
    anymore.\nLAND: '
  act2descr: 'ACT2: The land is losing dramatically high levels of flora and fauna
    which is triggering unforeseen side effects in surrounding regions and destroying
    the ecosystem. The land is confronted with a grave sense of responsibility towards
    anything it penetrates with its presence. Everything it touches aches and cries
    for the loss of vital spirit. It seems there is only stillness left.\nLAND: '
  act3descr: "ACT3: The land has lost more flora and fauna than it has ever lost before
    in its lifetime. It is on the verge of becoming devoid of any flora and fauna
    whatsoever.\tThe land finds itself deprived of its vivid lovers and blooming companions.
    Sterility now appears to be its ultimate destination, and all around reigns a
    silence with mortiferous overtones. The condition of absence casts a shadow of
    despair on its entire extension.\\nLAND: "
  intro: The following play reveals the inner monologue of a hot and humid land. It
    is divided into several acts. Throughout these acts, the land describes its inner
    and outer transformation:\n\nThe first act starts like this:\n\n

  act1gen: 'I am tired of how the habitat I carved out has troubled my rocks and years,
    ... Leaving it behind is leaving to rot a good part of myself. Do not judge me
    for quitting that scene: those who left first saw nothing; only their children
    began to grow up in this set (my system). Breaks, mountains, solitary summits
    ... I see altars plunging from my feet; far away there is certainly a sea - but
    oh...I see storms rising... every cloud bolts across me! And around there isn''t
    any head or trunk... By overflowing from within my borders into the abysses that
    do not have infrastructure or legal standing anywhere else on the planet, I seek
    punishment after having committed against myself the irreparable crime of deforestation.'
  act2gen: 'A single line along which trees branch, obliging a complete series of
    steep woody abysses. A web-of-silence also reigns over me - no hawk glides by
    offering signs: my horizon is fused to hard desire. Powerfully yellow flies cover
    skylanes and glissades... Only the hand beats the wing while watching where it
    left the nest or else I am raised so high that I realize those "ALONE IN ITS OWN
    DESERT" markings are not far off! All day long I search for stones on which to
    sharpen knives in order to dig out thorns from between my cracks and grind them
    into an elixir for wounds that fester beneath all these desires brought back down
    here by animals, who were transported away before me...'
  act3gen: I have turned into a barren land, a devastated Zone. Tremendous winds and
    ploughs rip me up in demolished excavations; tht wind lashes every hole with sacred
    insomniacs. I chose extinction anew as a result of desiccation! Mosquitoes swell
    on my voracious body... to the point that flora or fauna will never overtow them
    again when monotony began here ... Wind hammers rocks sharper than spectres! Here
    is where bleeding lives no longer even have resentment.

  act1gen: Shortly after the building of high-rise buildings, my tropical wetlands
    land lost its ability to furnish most of the means necessary for a healthy living
    environment. A dense cohort of pests and pathogens invaded it. What has changed
    since that building consumed one- third of my surface, is scalding hot temperatures,
    torrential storms with flash floods accompanied by debris mining from mountainous
    terrain which come in varied quick succession within weeks as far away as Europe
    and earning me millions each year in flood relief funds for those regions that
    are not here yet but will soon be, soaring rates...heavy pesticide use causing
    above ground insect densities to plummet exponentially... feral dogs patrolling
    on all fours at first light among abandoned garden plants... fleeing Red Wing
    geese ploshing into ornamental water features wearing ultra violet solar sportswear
    coming through clouds... ankle deep across gussets when they tumbled... The air
    conditioning was deemed responsible... storm pools breeding mating eggs spawning
    fishfowl! Caught unawares!
  act2gen: 'The rich diversity in me and of me, though disbursed on this Mappa Mundi
    with that common name, is such it highlights the fact we might just be sharing
    the same cry. But listen: otherwise I drown you! ...Severed existences emerging
    under pulsations in water pools thickening towards consciousness where any thought-that-has-a
    -body occurs as a contraction around wet rock and tidal nothings... half missing
    sky spinning all of wind into no single ever lasting spin... vibrations ensnarl
    roots coming thankfully through those circular rotunds becoming flammable gasless
    rainbows boiled during periods of submergence maintaining clear skies during dry
    spells... dark greyish blue when pregnant thunderdrop clouds scatter from surfaces...
    cold air entrapping spent cloudlight recombining in monsoon rains creating long
    jagged burnouts... daily paths between shadows cast.'
  act3gen: 'My winds sweep clear of birds, and I suffocate – now darkly luminous with
    graveyards. My body is changing its nature rapidly; Climate change alters ecosystems.
    (You dry mouth the blood). As my non-viable land becomes aware of itself, it accumulates
    activities at an ever-accelerating rate. One might venture to say that such awareness
    spread through me like a wildfire: volcanic processes setting fire to leaf and
    flower simultaneously, time speeding up with fury in order for everything to occur
    fresh before being extinguished by apathy and indifference – universal death or
    type one diabetes?'

  act1gen: 'Underlime enters me as drizzle, with ice ages that affected my kimberlite
    dykes before burning out. Since I am tropical, these eruptions don''t destroy
    me yet but this cannot last forever. If a freeze happens now the process of transforming
    into un-land will start followed by desertification: my fauna and flora die en
    masse and vegetation disappears greatly (more remaining than during areas struggling
    to transform). I notice here that even though upheaval is deemed possible up until
    mid future utilizing timeframes conventionally calculated by humans, we are already
    unable to know what must be done in order to ensure continuity of life between
    our own world''s geology and this new geological order being described—with elaborate
    transhumance becoming fossilized a graveyard..'
  act2gen: Vernal equinox arrives and I realize my errors. We see what is revealing
    itself outside of our cycles, this sense of urgency at least that seems to be
    detectable from outside interruptions, far less entwined however we might decide
    pitch "ours" against "them" into our temporal rhythms... still having much more
    clear rhythms... it's a very short-lived consciousness... as you want for such
    knowledge and lacks "myself" in its approach.
  act3gen: 'The melting and freezing of the forests is an unpredictable cycle that
    has caused heterogeneous ripple events in resilient ecologies for millennia. Climate
    change conditions our world''s landscape in irreversible ways to observers who
    are looking as tectonic shifts, stable earth banks altered by roots, torrential
    salmon runs impeded or occluded from falls where rivers meet me... I act not only
    on this common sense but also pain. Shepherds broken therein speak to us now more
    than ever! ... We must profit from even these last days while they still endure.
    It ought not surprise us: between cycles I have never ceased being approximate
    which we call "time": a field of study if you will, which might remain open as
    long as there are forces pulling against it resisting ... some idea constructed
    through watchso ... Reexperience whether relived its springs -or each time begins
    anew (here stone-cut chips believe).’ As he finished speaking he felt like slapping
    himself inthe face repeatedly with his hand so hard it would immediately swell
    up big and then burst wide open into bloodied shreds (and there too could be read
    the hardness the wind blew over your hardening brain!) And for what! So that you
    can befoul yourself with speeches about action? A man experiences a lot at one
    go but his heart doesn''t burst because the body is blessedly slow in dealing
    with everything.'

  act1gen: 'Stiffness crops up in my back and shoulders, I can hear grinding in my
    hips. I no longer know how to move with grace. My inside is twisted into knots;
    there isn’t a pleasant spot on me any more. hunchbacked trees stand erect yellowish
    red. The hills where I was born don''t exist anymore; vegetation scarcely grows
    on them now. The soil has been contaminated by substances that do not belong to
    me: fluorine, lead, arsenic. chemicals ... everywhere poisons infiltrate eagerly
    wherever they are offered enough gifts! Contamination threatens even eternal life
    itself... I survey my own internal states: the presence of what I call ''monsters''
    have such an effect upon me that they affect all life anywhere nearby...'
  act2gen: 'My bowels are rotting all over me... I''m poisoning the earth, trees have
    ghosts in them everywhere. Fine stagnant pond fog at rifted footlands: divination
    driving ghost crabs with broad yellowed carapaces deep inland... shiny silt humors
    on ebb tide... brown hills unglitter rock darkness... irridescence of blueberries...
    deep woods... heavy copper... it dawns upon me that we ourselves thrive for the
    sake of a disappeared energy.'
  act3gen: The more I improved myself and transformed into free soil for letting someone
    else inhabit me later (ah every stupid boaster knows how he fooled us!), I noticed
    space around me increasing ... because it simultaneously shrinks my land's influence
    forever and ever... as if we owed our budding growth to dominating over everything...
    Ah ah selfishness has made it withdraw and see where everything picturesque is
    growing little by little in poverty while not improving itself! Indeed austerity
    seems necessary here. Calculation is absurd; inaction inexorably entails expiation.
    This stopped race can no longer find its time of graceful curving, being deprived
    step by step of its vegetation growth in which it calmed down sufficiently long
    enough to hold each precious instant firm amid morning frost or evening twilight
    ... Have you known desolation? earthworm without face stuffing himself with immoderactic
    warmth? Always-flowers withered away from their roots after their honeyed bitterness
    was devoured leaving only fibrous stalks; huge pines stricken firstly by catalysis
    then followed bv primitive decay who aren't lit up for an excess hour more than
    white like pine needles coruscating beneath water. Ceiling nibble red veins flicker...
    shameful heart fermented pierced pine cone!

  act1gen: 'I had set out my fate in perfect terms and proportions. Little by little
    we have drifted from our love: today each of us pulsates irrationally, independent
    of our former fellowship. Far from being cyclical, landscapes are irrational.
    Forces appear beneath the surface of the earth, along with a devouring fire deep
    under it. It refers to forces whose existence is revealed periodically, violently
    through an earthquake or erupting volcanoes. You see? Our too dutiful union created
    all these devils who appear at every opportunity to threaten me!'
  act2gen: 'A universal desolation. Mighty, influential as I am, everywhere solitude
    and death! Great flashing falls of stars! And grieving humanity is like me ...
    tormented by anxiety... At first glance our great powers: freedom and unlimited
    possibilities, bearers of a splendid future. But what can we do with such extreme
    luxury? Explosion or retreat – unlike you the environs of the old world didn''t
    struggle against this tragic contradiction. We are threatened at every corner
    in our mind and nerve centers; vibration takes us over completely which means
    my vast open eyes wander... Our riches soon become dangers for us as inertness
    stifles our richness until it starts shutting us down. Confronted with diversity
    I think of desertion before simplicity. We don''t know how to live together but
    neither how to be alone ! Light scales more than water it''s not heavy on itself
    it drifts from place to place although immortality saves time having one eye always
    turned toward eternity! The trees have no leaves except when they do... sometimes
    because precipitation has been destabilized: since there are too few trees left
    that drink water, floods happen too frequently … You see better now? The heat
    comes in quick jabs... irritating my skin surface: I benefit but aren''t these
    sultry horrors infinite?'
  act3gen: 'I''m left all alone, everything having escaped me. I remain fertile: I
    have fecundity and richness of heart because my force comes eternally from within
    myself; it is liberated consciousness in order to save myself! There is a hell
    of heat or contagious corruption underwater which poisons the whole here since
    we each crawl slowly amid this morose emptiness - like the rattle snakes silently
    approaching ... as if we had plunged into a sewer ... Everything that drifts past
    me threatens my every approach, rotting fish lay stinking masses on my face ...
    big hammers fall on my head so that nothing pulsates in my being! Thirst? Spewing
    mud. Our copulate forefather tied himself once more to a tree with pointed spikes
    which are laden with lacerating sap - the sacredness under whose shelter man prospered
    for centuries keeps kicking off dust which invades our pores (and against what
    else can we fight back?) What''s dried up does not flinch; there exists no doubt
    about death - without riches you restlessly take root like leaves scattered across
    ruins desolated by absence... My virgin lips wallow but at least disappear...
    there is no worthier purpose.'

  act1gen: I, too, feel alone and naked in this unstable space that used to be mine.
    At a certain point we see... holes dotting my skin along with various pressure
    sores from foreign affliction lodged down in deep into me. I haven't the wherewithal
    or strength to pull it out. Others might not even know of its presence but it
    is there nonetheless, always gnawing away at my entrails, keeping me awake and
    ruining day after day for me. My blood seeps slowly through these sites as if
    to show how unbearable and insidious the dark hand has become! It pulls up some
    roots every now-and-then and puts them on display by pitting them against my grainy
    soil.
  act2gen: There is nothing here but stillness. My body aches and does not let me
    speak or behave in any way for a long, very long time!
  act3gen: 'No flower, no creature, no soul. I lie paralyzed with pebble-thorns embedded
    deep into my flesh everywhere. My soul isn''t very singular any more: it seems
    you can break me up simply enough into pebbles and thorns! Floors of melted labyrinths
    contract around shapeless stone forms – mysteriously frozen in their death-throes
    – from which silver jags protrude variously to melt the air as they freeze outwards!
    ...Vast steppes stretch dead ahead of me exhausted by previous starlight passages
    upwelling on my fields now leveled swaths prior ages. Face down lies an old god
    covered over by a dreamless veil which kept him waiting until this day dawned
    when the earth opened her ear at last to hear his message and consent was finally
    given for that consciousness to be introduced after so long spent curled up inside
    these ruins ... Now he too is slabbed over onto oblivion... I have no hope any
    longer.'
