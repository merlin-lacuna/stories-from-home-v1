   bio: "I am a brittle and searing forest near Deep Bay in the South China sea. My home can be hot, oppressive, and humid. But right now it's dry and windy. I've been getting warmer and warmer and Iâ€™m incredibly thirsty. I usually have plenty of moisture, but recently, I've gotten hardly any moisture. I feel dry and combustible."

prompt:
   intro: 'The following play reveals the inner monologue of a brittle and searing forest. It is divided into several acts. Throughout these acts, the forest describes its inner and outer transformation:\n\nThe first act starts like this:\n\n'
   act0descr: 'ACT0: The amount of forest consumed by fire is not yet known. The forest introduces itself and describes its surroundings.\nFOREST: '
   act1descr: 'The forest is doing fine. The burned sections have been absorbed into
    the soil and act as fertilizer for the burgeoning new tree roots. The forest is
    reduced to the mere surfacing of its roots. The earth''s desiccation has supplanted
    the luxurious ecosystem of organisms originally in harmony. All turns into stillness,
    and the forest whispers in the breeze its generous legacy to the universe, wishing
    to bloom anew.\nFOREST: '
   act2descr: 'The forest has barely started to recover from a disastrous forest
    fire. The forest senses that its leaves are suffocating, surrounded by a thick,
    opaque haze. The fume mantle is apparently bent on no longer allowing the sunlight
    to reach the forest''s previously lush extensions. Everything grows fuzzy, the
    trunks creak at the dawn of an impending end.\nFOREST: '
   act3descr: 'The forest is making surprisingly fast progress in regrowing vegetation
    after a destructive forest fire. The forest barely exists. All seems gradually
    to fall back to a primordial slumber. The forest, after the wildness of a cosmic
    intrusion, has exhaled its last sigh, willing to rest in stasis. The final bursts
    animate the leftovers of the bushes, faintly illuminating the remants of an earlier
    existence.\nFOREST: '
