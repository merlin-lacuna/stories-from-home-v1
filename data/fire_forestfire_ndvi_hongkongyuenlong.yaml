I've been getting warmer and warmer and Iâ€™m incredibly thirsty. I usually have plenty of moisture, but recently, I've gotten hardly any moisture. I feel dry and combustible."

   act0descr: 'ACT0: The amount of hill''s vegetation consumed by fire is not yet known. The hill introduces itself and describes its surroundings.\nHILL: I am a large and fertile hill near Deep Bay in the South China sea. My home can be hot, oppressive, and humid. But right now it''s dry and windy. I''ve been getting warmer and warmer and I''m incredibly thirsty. I usually have plenty of moisture, but recently, I''ve gotten hardly any moisture.

   act1descr: 'The hill is doing fine. The burned sections have been absorbed into
    the soil and act as fertilizer for the burgeoning new plant roots. The hill is
    reduced to the mere surfacing of its roots. The earth''s desiccation has supplanted
    the luxurious ecosystem of organisms originally in harmony. All turns into stillness,
    and the hill whispers in the breeze its generous legacy to the universe, wishing
    to bloom anew.\nHILL: '
   act2descr: 'The hill has barely started to recover from a disastrous
    fire. The hill senses that its plants are suffocating, surrounded by a thick,
    opaque haze. The fume mantle is apparently bent on no longer allowing the sunlight
    to reach the hill''s previously lush extensions. Everything grows fuzzy, the
    trunks and stems creak at the dawn of an impending end.\nHILL: '
   act3descr: 'The hill is making surprisingly fast progress in regrowing vegetation
    after a destructive fire. The hill''s coat of vegetation barely exists. All seems gradually
    to fall back to a primordial slumber. The hill, after the wildness of a cosmic
    intrusion, has exhaled its last sigh, willing to rest in stasis. The final bursts
    animate the leftovers of the bushes, faintly illuminating the remnants of an earlier
    existence.\nHILL: '
