  bio: 'I am the grand peak, standing tall and strong, a majestic sight, surrounded by lush forests. My slopes are steep, my crags are rugged, a natural fortress, with stories yet to be told. My summit is cold, my base is warm, a body of contrasts, a natural wonder. My soil is rich, my water is pure, a haven for flora, a serene vista. Some people call my forest the "Google Forest". My streams are pristine, a symphony of nature, with diverse wildlife and birds that sing sweet, a melody to cherish.'

  act1descr: 'The land''s rainfall is at normal levels. The land is elastic and smooth, it resonates with harmonious resilience to both outward and inward impulses. It is apt to cradle and nurture its encircling landscapes. The soil shaping its presence is salubrious and bursting with scintillating strength. The humidity gives birth to iridescent veins within the terrain.'
  act2descr: 'The land''s rainfall is still at to normal levels. The land is still elastic and smooth, it resonates with harmonious resilience to both outward and inward impulses. It is apt to cradle and nurture its encircling landscapes. The soil shaping its presence is salubrious and bursting with scintillating strength. The humidity gives birth to iridescent veins within the terrain.'
  act3descr: 'The land''s rainfall is somewhat reduced. The precipitation is at unusually low levels. The land slowly becomes opaque. Once it was possible to detect sheets of water through which a portion of the universe was mirroring itself. Now the reflections of the heaven are shrinking. All around, life''s impetus faces a crash, and the land stumbles into dehydration.'
