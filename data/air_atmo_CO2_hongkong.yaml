   intro: 'The following play reveals the inner monologue of a rich and complex land. It is divided into several acts. Throughout these acts, the land describes its inner and outer transformation:\n\nThe first act starts like this:\n\n'
   act0descr: 'ACT0: The c02 levels in the air above the land are not yet known. The land introduces itself and describes its surroundings.\nLAND: '
   act1descr: 'ACT1: The c02 in the air above the land is at tolerable levels. Although there is more carbon dioxide in the air, the ecosystem of the land is still coping well. Equilibrium is offering a bright pace to the land. This represents the highest aim to which all the eras yearn. Balance''s oscillation is a brittle and alluring condition. The CO2 acts in synergy with the organisms that enliven the land; each creature is attuned to its own inner states. The whole energy on the globe is geared and activated to react to the anomalies with a generating spirit.\nLAND: '
   act2descr: 'ACT2: The c02 in the air above the land is at dire, extreme levels. The carbon dioxide is causing suffocating greenhouse effects, smothering the land with oppressive heat. The CO2 springs with an implacable crescendo. Its load swells incautiously. It''s the burden of the cosmos itself. Everything around stagnates in stasis. A grey, stifling density pervades the entire land''s atmosphere, decking everything exists on its way. An airy wave of faded hopes is ruling.\nLAND: '
   act3descr: 'ACT3: The c02 in the air above the land has gotten better but it is still at worrying levels. There is too much carbon dioxide in the air and the ecosystem of the land is beginning to suffer. The breezy rhythm at which the clouds used to dance appears to be muted. A colourless omen looms, like a shadow from which absolutely nothing can evade. The land is getting darker under this threat. The C02 is keeping the environment under siege, poised to make its graceful vigor perish.\nLAND: '
