   bio: "I speak – no names upon me, birthed From primordial history''s dark womb, as Cosmic seas birthed storms and tempests, now languish, bleeding fertility To bind my glacial cradle tight. Behold my emerald shroud, gossamer veils, draped in mist; A lacework of droplets, as I, mopéd, seek my lover – the fickle sun, every dawn, in vain, indulges his transient warmth. Bathed in the swirling mist of amaranthine passion, yet confined by labyrinthine drystone walls, i straddle two realms - between paradise and ruin, and spread my bountiful entrails beneath a twilight sky. No yowling tempests, nor fury-threatened shore, shall ever contain my trembling madness; For it is into the sea’s abyssal cradle, i silently submit, dissolving in Eros’ saline tears. Solitary oaks stand as witnesses, of my age-old courtship, ever fruitless, each silvan sentinel – soldier of a forgotten era, pageantry remnants of seasons’ waning desires. My barren womb nourishes foreign kin, fleecy drifters graze ‘pon my grassy flesh, entwined with the prickly touch of verdant heather; Engulfing their sorrow in my supple, unseen bosom. Crowded brooks carve channels through my flesh, and fickle winds whisper secrets in my ear, intimate murmurs of mystery, of throes and throbs, but none shall claim the deep, dark caverns of my heart. Amongst the shadows of clouded thoughts, ghosts of eras passed echo lost secrets, their past presence burning upon my soul, as the specter of transient humanity implores my forgiveness. I am the forgotten fragment, stretching aeons wide, how fleeting is this minuscule moment, as I stand in silent contemplation, bearing witness, to the tender union of fleeting flesh and fiery desire. I dissolve into the ethereal and vaporous embrace Of an azure canopy kissing the horizon, boundless time, shrouded in mystery, majestic silence speaks me – the haunted, the untamed."

   intro: 'The following play reveals the inner monologue of a picturesque, rugged, mountainous and temperate region of land that has been ravished by a wildfire. It is divided into several acts. Throughout these acts, the land describes its inner and outer transformation:\n\nThe first act starts like this:\n\n'
   act0descr: 'ACT0: The damage caused by the wildfire is not yet known. The land introduces itself and describes its surroundings.\nLAND:'
   act1descr: 'ACT1: The land is doing fine. Any old burned sections have been absorbed into the soil and act as fertilizer for the burgeoning new tree roots. The land is enhanced by the mere surfacing of its roots. The earth''s desiccation had supplanted the luxurious ecosystem of organisms originally in harmony but now it is in a resurgence. All turns into stillness, and the land whispers in the breeze its generous legacy to the universe, wishing to bloom anew.\nLAND:'
   act2descr: 'ACT2: The land is still doing fine. Any old burned sections are continuing to be absorbed into the soil and are acting as fertilizer for the burgeoning new tree roots. The land is enhanced by the mere surfacing of its roots. The earth''s desiccation had supplanted the luxurious ecosystem of organisms originally in harmony but it is still in a resurgence. All turns into stillness, and the land whispers in the breeze its generous legacy to the universe, wishing to bloom anew.\nLAND:'
   act3descr: 'ACT3: The land is making surprisingly fast progress in regrowing vegetation after a destructive forest fire. The land’s vegetation barely exists. All seems gradually to fall back to a primordial slumber. The land’s vegetation, after the wildness of a cosmic intrusion, has exhaled its last sigh, willing to rest in stasis. The final bursts animate the leftovers of the bushes, faintly illuminating the remnants of an earlier existence.\nLAND:'
