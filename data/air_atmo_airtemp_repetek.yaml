    bio: "In the breath of the Kara Kum desert, I lay, a golden sea, waves of sand, surging and settling, here, upon my bosom, ancient mysteries kept \nIn groaning silence, secrets whispered through the roots, of my \nHaloxylon, Saxual forests; like sparse, adorned armor \nShielding me against eternity's harsh gaze. \nA myriad of lives I nourish and cradle. \nAt night, beneath the celestial canopy, my children of tortoise, and deserts bat, roam free, a plentitude, of wings and limbs, sing of rapture, yet within quiet reaches of my arid heart, joy entwines the sorrows of existence; \nThe soft suffring, of the Saker falcon, rages \nAgainst the rotting plagues, my branches, ravished bare \nAnd fleeting presence of man blurs the edges, a thirst now unquenched, celestial murmurs \nIn gloomy undulations of change. \nBut marvel still, O wanderer, at my visage antique, the chiseled sands erode, but remain my stories \nIn hands intertwined with browning bark, within the nurturing embrace of my flora, oh, listen, to the million melodies that flow \nThrough my veins and deep roots, entangled mysteries \nOf lives that have been, and those that shall be. \n'Repent, repent!'â€”Nay, for I stand in defiance, bold and resilient against the ruthless winds: \nThe scorching sun burns and bends, and I rise again, suspicion and regret, cast into distant echoes, i choose not to quench, but to reverberate my thirst, as a fuel, to hold me closer to my birthright, To exist. \nAnd so, I stand, though legions afield falter, a sentinel, fierce, unbowed before the oncoming storm, and I shall emerge anew, in time, to carry forth \nThe ancient wisdom of my forebears, silenced now, but not forsaken, yet within life's grasp."

   intro: 'The following play reveals the inner monologue of an arid and sweltering region land that is nature reserve. It is divided into several acts. Throughout these acts, the land describes its inner and outer transformation:\n\nThe first act starts like this:\n\n'
   act0descr: 'ACT0: The temperature of the air above the land is not yet known. The land introduces itself and describes its surroundings.\nLAND:'
   act1descr: 'ACT1: The land is not experiencing anything out of the ordinary. The air is dry but not unusually so. It supports a thriving ecosystem. The land nevertheless realizes that the sun has always been his constant companion, his guidance, his star and his faith. Perhaps it should once again trust the rays that stroke its sandy surface, however brutally.\nLAND:'
   act2descr: 'ACT2: The land''s air is drier than it usually is and its ecosystem is beginning to struggle. All the granules of sand seem to vanish, and the land is now confronted with a hopeless state of inability to react. It no more has full control of the constituents that used to form its body and spirit. All crumbles and pales under a merciless sun.\nLAND:'
   act3descr: 'ACT3: The land''s air is extremely dry and there is barely any moisture for organisms to survive. The drought of the land is no longer its vital condition, as it no longer seems to originate from its very essence, but rather due to unknown and destructive external forces impossible to placate.\nLAND:'
