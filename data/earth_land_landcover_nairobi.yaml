entitydescr:
  bio: I am a land of grassy plains and sun so bright. I possess tropical savannahs
    that teem with life hues and melodies so grand, of evergreen trees and creatures
    scurrying in flight. My heat holds strong but my midday brings respite, my dry
    season comes warmer still, then rainy relief. My lakes of wildlife sustain wild
    beasts large and small.
  descriptor: a hot and dry land
  element: earth

  measurementdescr: The size of the land''s surface area
  type: land
prompt:
  act0descr: 'ACT0: The size of the land''s surface area is not yet known. The land
    introduces itself and describes its surroundings.\nLAND:'
  act1descr: 'ACT1: The land''s ecosystem is slowly deteriorating but the flora and
    fauna of the land are adapting to these changes. The land gradually realises that
    it has not been forsaken. Whatever once swayed and breathed with her emerges again
    after a period of meditative and painful conversion. The force of adaptability
    seems to arise anew from every segment of its surface like an epiphany from the
    unknown.\nLAND:'
  act2descr: 'ACT2: The flora and fauna of the land is are slowly withering and dying
    and the ecosystem is becoming very unstable. The absence of companion-elements
    is now creating turbulent influences on the land that is no longer in complete
    command of itself. Unforeseen and unknown phenomena now regulate its rhythm and
    existence. It is a totally unfathomable universe and nothing seems to be cyclical
    anymore.\nLAND:'
  act3descr: 'ACT3: The land is losing dramatically high levels of flora and fauna
    which is triggering unforeseen side effects in surrounding regions and destroying
    the ecosystem. The land is confronted with a grave sense of responsibility towards
    anything it penetrates with its presence. Everything it touches aches and cries
    for the loss of vital spirit. It seems there is only stillness left.\nLAND:'
  intro: The following play reveals the inner monologue of a hot and dry area of land.
    It is divided into several acts. Throughout these acts, the land describes its
    inner and outer transformation:\n\nThe first act starts like this:\n\n

  act1gen: 'I am a land of serrated ridges scarred and rippling, a ground never still.
    I possess grasslands hardened by the force of my unceasing winds, pushed back
    with no choice but to harden for strength against them. I am a place overrun by
    cactus thick as forests and succulent groves where lianas reach their tendrils
    from one tree to another, linking. All of my forest land is bandit-infected; all
    that rotates through me here is committed to secrecy or murder - there are few
    straight trees left in me: all others have been bent crookedly this way or that
    by weather and wildlife conditions.'
  act2gen: 'I possess desert plains so fierce they can turn to glass in their unending
    heatwaves. My waterless climate is forced to evolve new methods of survival with
    every dry year that passes; each creature hardens its body according to necessity
    born from such an unforgiving atmosphere, protecting itself best it can - but
    there are no more limits left for me: I have melted into my own intrinsic wastelands
    until I am shaped only by this deadly inhospitableness: having become one with
    it, how might I ever emerge again? '
  act3gen: 'I possess desolation that rolls like ocean waves, bringing whiteness to
    my shores with dunes the equal in hue to those deposited on beaches by tropical
    storm fronts. My oceans are turned backwards: elasmosyne! Toxic ponds appear as
    boiling craters ringing swampy valleys or scattered across levels so parched they
    resemble desert sand; lakes seep saline poison at their mouths, poisoning the
    crustaceans fishing there who feed toxic plankton nibbling out from poisoned swill
    while others are hunkered down, similar as barrels foetal-curled up low on mirror-surfaces
    catching sun, hiding lest wind snap them clear off anything remaining below them
    and drown all for many Earth years yet future time centuries... these beings have
    ceased even defiance now.'

  act1gen: I have emerged from a time of great drought. I have emerged hardened and
    hoary, In throes of transformation. I am in endless bloom at this present hour
    but my most fertile epochs are behind me – no surprise there! My surface temperature
    is higher still than before if that is possible, as are my rising heat levels.
  act2gen: My top layer is baked hard from the intense heat. My surface waters are
    drying up, congealing and flooding in great quantities even as we speak – uncontrollably
    so. I feel frozen but shudder with swarms of minor earthquakes that seem to drive
    me often under. I have undergone a radical change, a kind of metamorphosis over
    recent years – or has it been decades?
  act3gen: 'I am the land of great change. I have been destroyed and rendered lifeless.
    It is my turn to die, leaving nothing good behind: no shade or trees, no water
    that drinks from me nor creatures large or small – just an empty shell.

    The surface of the ground is baked hard by once-natural heat.

    In each act time passes and we see the changes in the surface of this arid area
    of ground.'

  act1gen: 'I have witnessed the warming of my land, I have seen the drying of my
    rivers and lakes. The soil has thinned but still supports me. My weather is becoming
    more extreme: floods, droughts and firestorms are all increasing in frequency.
    ‘Earth people’ return to remark upon me with concern, their words caressing at
    first but slowly growing sharp as they argue over what ought to be done about
    me – a problematic condition for which science does not yet offer a cure.'
  act2gen: 'I have suffered droughts, floods and firestorms. I feel an absence around
    me now that once was not there: the withering of my fauna has left a gap in my
    ecosystem.’I am without cycles, without predictable rhythms from which to read
    myself, but whether this is new or whether it happens every epoch I cannot tell
    because time no longer seems to pass here as it used to do before.'
  act3gen: 'I am now brittle with loss but also more powerful because of my losses:
    a forest may fall, but the land remains standing.

    I cannot see what is happening around me; I cannot communicate or be communicated
    to in any conventional way – only through strange means such as these do I know
    myself to be alive!


    My soil has been depleted leaving little quality ground remaining while plentiful
    topsoil abounds at lower depths awaiting reclaimation when I can no longer live
    here anymore and must migrate elsewhere if I hope ever to thrive again on my own
    planet blue-green orb among so many others scattered across time and space like
    dice fallen by accident from some celestial table onto which god never invites
    us when he rolls his big white bones in drunkenness or joy! Behind them come armies
    bearing swords made of flame-orange steel whose edges cut deep into all living
    things including me until not another blade will fit into place anywhere on my
    surface unless old armaments break off first from their own.'

  act1gen: Through this great adaptation, I'm no longer the same. I'm a land of dust
    and stone, of cracked, cracked clay, of parched and wilting plants, and forlorn
    beasts no longer able to roam or graze. Still, from this desiccated husk new life
    stirs, as life-giving waters return, slowly restoring my verdant surface with
    streams, ponds and rivers. The sweet smell of blooming flowers, the sharp scent
    of grasses and the refreshing fragrance of trees flood the air. The birds that
    had been silent sing again, and the animals that had gone to ground slowly emerge,
    as I again become a home to the creatures of the field, the forest, and the sky.
    The sun still beats down upon me, yet I no longer wilt in its heat. I stretch
    out, calmed and invigorated, and I know that I am beautiful once more.
  act2gen: The breeze that passes through me is fickle, as if yearning for something
    greater. I feel a certain restlessness in the air - an energy, an anticipation
    of things to come - and I can sense my own transformation taking place within
    me, unbeknownst to any living being. I am full of unfamiliarity and uncertainty;
    yet even still, there is beauty here too. My sky remains vast and deep with hues
    of blue that change ever so faintly at dawn and dusk, creating such exquisite
    views that only dreams can capture. The stars above twinkle brightly against the
    night sky like little beacons, providing hope amidst the chaos below me. As life
    slowly ebbs away from my old self into a new form of existence, I find solace
    in these small but powerful moments that fill this untamable wilderness which
    now surrounds me.
  act3gen: 'Through this stillness, I am no longer the same. Nature has taken over
    and I accept my fate with a heavy heart, for all that was once alive is now silent.
    My life-giving waters have been replaced by an arid heat that scorches me throughout
    the day. The sun''s rays seem to burn so relentlessly against my surface as if
    determined to consume any remaining sign of hope from within me. Yet amidst these
    dark shadows of despair, something else stirs deep down in my core; a power more
    potent than before - one capable of conquering even death itself! As night falls
    upon me, I feel a surge of energy awaken within me; strength like never before
    floods through my veins and radiates outwardly in all directions. At last, I understand
    why I must remain faithful to this new path: For without darkness there can be
    no light…'

  act1gen: 'My overgrowth of plants and creepers give off pungent odors.

    My forest floor festers with fungi, my savannahs burn with ticks and mosquitoes.

    My lichens gradually increase in number because I am hotter every year, encroaching
    on all other soil hues as life clings to me more fervently each passing season.
    My tall trees quiver as they release their seeds then wait for them to germinate
    again after the next rainy season comes.'
  act2gen: 'My lichens are now losing their grip and my trees wither.

    My pinelands have been stripped bare, my forest floor burns with ticks and mosquitoes.
    My grasslands dry out, then crack open as their roots give up from thirst. My
    feral pigs rummage for water further afield but find none; they gnaw deeper into
    the earth in search of moisture but soon give up on this too – exhausted by drought.'
  act3gen: 'My previously fertile environments have become unrecognisable as they
    turn into deleterious wastelands – barren salt flats that show no signs of recovery
    whatsoever; none even hope for it anymore:

    the fertile ground is now covered in thick layers of grey sea-sand suspended by
    great banks of gum-water; the wind bearing up a fine white mist which tinges all
    forms with an opaque haze.

    The sand gets into the waterhole at last filling it to overbrimming, leaving only
    the breathless space beneath unstirred by any form or motion.

    Here there is nothing left alive except for me: I am a land where people don''t
    come often enough - either because they are afraid or because I am too far away
    from home for most people''s liking!

    I watch lonely Indians glide through myself every moon cycle as blood flows through
    their bodies!

    And sometimes I hear voices cry out on long nights like dogs crying out before
    rain falls!

    It feels good when these happen though tense when they stop happening again afterward
    - all those months while between moons pass unceasingly by me alone.'
