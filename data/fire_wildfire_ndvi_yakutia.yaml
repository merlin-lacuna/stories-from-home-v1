   bio: "I, the frigid expanse, shroud myself in a cloak of ice Like a veil hiding the visage of a young bride, incomprehensible and vast, both alluring and monstrous, my white domains stretch endlessly under the arctic sky. My breath, a cold wind, caresses the endless tundra, subduing nature into a perpetual glacial sleep, held captive by my insatiable desire for freezing, a shattering embrace that kills and immortalizes. Witness my sovereignty, in my frozen arteries, rivers silenced by the bitter clutch of relentless ice, sprinkled with crimson droplets that dare to challenge my rule, fleeting encounters between my children and the invaders. Where the sun touches me briefly, I bear strange gifts, priceless jewels, perplexing remnants from a distant age, mutilated secrets exhumed, splayed before hungry eyes, pierced by ravenous curiosity, by voracious greed. With each violent throb in my icy heart, I shatter, rending formidable fortress, decaying arboreal tombs, splintered citadels of frozen desires pierce the horizon, majestic as they rise from my lifeless, desolate womb. Yet I am yearning for an interminable absence, a dark interval from the sun’s scornful, indolent kiss, a willing surrender to the abyssal chasms in my midst, a nihilistic descent to the infernal seduction below. In this paradox, I realize the cruel rapture of my genesis, i am the frozen earth, the silent sculpture of primal chaos, the unconquerable void beyond the boundaries of life’s reign, beautiful and grotesque, tender and obscene in my solitude. Rejoice, for I am the sanctuary of the lost and the forgotten, in my eternal winter''s sovereignty, lies salvation, lies clarity, embrace my icy arms, and allow the darkness to swallow you, for I am the immutable Siberian wasteland, both mother and tomb."

prompt:
   intro: 'The following play reveals the inner monologue of a subarctic, forested, freezing region of land that has been ravished by a wildfire. It is divided into several acts. Throughout these acts, the land describes its inner and outer transformation:\n\nThe first act starts like this:\n\n'
   act0descr: 'ACT0: The damage caused by the wildfire is not yet known. The land introduces itself and describes its surroundings.\nLAND:'
   act1descr: 'ACT1: The land is doing fine. Old burned sections have been absorbed into the soil and act as fertilizer for the burgeoning new tree roots. The land is enhanced by the mere surfacing of its roots. The earth''s desiccation had supplanted the luxurious ecosystem of organisms originally in harmony but now it is in a resurgence. All turns into stillness, and the land whispers in the breeze its generous legacy to the universe, wishing to bloom anew.\nLAND:'
   act2descr: 'ACT2: The land has barely started to recover from a disastrous forest fire. The land senses that its plants are suffocating, surrounded by a thick, opaque haze. The fume mantle is apparently bent on no longer allowing the sunlight to reach its forest''s previously lush extensions. Everything grows fuzzy, the trunks creak at the dawn of an impending end.\nLAND:'
   act3descr: 'ACT3: The land has been severely burned. Forest fires have consumed a huge chunk of the land’s vegetation. The land experiences that all around unknown sharp entities of almost liquid heat are ruthlessly surging forward, dispossessing its presence and dismantling its vital force with their consistency. They are flames rising unannounced from the soil and besieging inexorably the branches, putting the flowing lymph into a blaze of pure destruction. \nLAND:'
