   bio: "I, the liminal edge where sapphire meets lava-born soil, cradle the dreams of terrestrial souls, sculpted by quivering fingers of an ancient dormant beast, I bear the burden of a charred heritage, my children blossom, woven with the silk of the Aeolian winds. My breath; a fusion of fire and water, a paradoxical dance of eternal reinvention, i, the cradle of civilizations past and present, of ageless tales whispered in every lapping wave, or secrets told by the tendrils of my watchful vines, where citrus and almond trees rise towards the heavens, a testimony to the cyclic renewal of time's embrace. In me, the sun bathes the day, voracious and ravenous, my soil pregnant with Dionysian delights, the sweat of desire cascades upon my wooded slopes, through the fervor of Etna's smoldering maw, the thirsty roots of my creation seek sustenance, my offering to the insatiable gods of old. Night descends, a cloak of cool rejuvenation, moonlit piazzas where youth seek solace in their dreams, my winds cool the passions simmering beneath, caressing the olive groves with a gentle whisper, mingling with the echoes of laughter and lament. In the shadows of my caverns, the mysteries unfold, my liquid touch connects humanity with the divine, the tenuous bond between perception and reality, dissolving in the murmur of my waves, I am the throbbing heartbeat, contrasting the eternal stillness of the stars. For I am life, and life is metamorphosis, I am the density of volcanic ash, the pliability of sand sculpted by millennia, I consume the ire of the gods, transmuting calamity into fecund beauty, embracing the paradox that defines my existence, I; boundless, ever-changing, and infinitely renewed."
