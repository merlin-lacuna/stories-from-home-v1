   bio: "I, the liminal edge where sapphire meets lava-born soil, cradle the dreams of terrestrial souls, sculpted by quivering fingers of an ancient dormant beast, I bear the burden of a charred heritage, my children blossom, woven with the silk of the Aeolian winds. My breath; a fusion of fire and water, a paradoxical dance of eternal reinvention, i, the cradle of civilizations past and present, of ageless tales whispered in every lapping wave, or secrets told by the tendrils of my watchful vines, where citrus and almond trees rise towards the heavens, a testimony to the cyclic renewal of time''s embrace. In me, the sun bathes the day, voracious and ravenous, my soil pregnant with Dionysian delights, the sweat of desire cascades upon my wooded slopes, through the fervor of Etna''s smoldering maw, the thirsty roots of my creation seek sustenance, my offering to the insatiable gods of old. Night descends, a cloak of cool rejuvenation, moonlit piazzas where youth seek solace in their dreams, my winds cool the passions simmering beneath, caressing the olive groves with a gentle whisper, mingling with the echoes of laughter and lament. In the shadows of my caverns, the mysteries unfold, my liquid touch connects humanity with the divine, the tenuous bond between perception and reality, dissolving in the murmur of my waves, I am the throbbing heartbeat, contrasting the eternal stillness of the stars. For I am life, and life is metamorphosis, I am the density of volcanic ash, the pliability of sand sculpted by millennia, I consume the ire of the gods, transmuting calamity into fecund beauty, embracing the paradox that defines my existence, I; boundless, ever-changing, and infinitely renewed."

   act1descr: 'ACT1: A volcano that lies within the land is erupting, destroying neighboring forest and blocking out the sun. The land can''t avoid its inescapable fate, its destiny is that of crawling out from the earth that mourns, groans in a wail of despair. It is called to break away from its primal origin, and is left within an abyssal turmoil.\nLAND:'
   act2descr: 'ACT2: The volcano that lies within the land is dormant and stable. It helps the land to nurture its rich ecosystem. The land is fully alive and thriving thanks to a blazing source of destructive renewal. Its blistering lymph sprouts incautiously from the very core of the earth. Lava has merged with the soil and fulfilled that land''s cravings for freedom.\nLAND:'
   act3descr: 'ACT3: A volcano that lies within the land is again getting very hot and emiting noxious gasses. The volcano''s limbs are imprisoned in between incorruptible rocky concretions within the land. It experiences a reckless drive to turn its surroundings into utmost chaos.
