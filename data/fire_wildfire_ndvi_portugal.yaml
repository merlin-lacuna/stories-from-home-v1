   bio: "I am a parched region, baptized by fire, a lingering kiss upon the searing sun, in an arid realm, where desire reigns, my landscapes stretch, infinite and unyielding. From twisted roots, the cork and the carob rise, a crooked testament to resist, to thrive amidst the scorching winds, weathering adversity with a quivering resilience. I am a confluence of cultures and civilizations, a testament to their strife and debate, ruins of antiquity litter my body Rest my secret histories upon my sunbathing stones. In a seamless embrace, my marshes cradle the flocks, tending the salt pans, their labor crystallizes In dazzling white mounds, a testament to persistence, their reward, a shimmering saline atlas. The storks, they glide, making their wading dance In limpid waters, the flamingo and spoonbill tarry, silhouettes grace my salt-laden winds, a ballet of earthly sediments and wandering lust. From the gentle lapping of the tides, my estuaries exult, whispering of exploration, of silent vigils where the land meets the sea, my miles-long beaches stretch in rhapsodies of sand. I am the realm that endures the sun''s scorching reign, where the scorched earth sighs from her hallowed depths, a cadence of seduction and surrender, but never conceding my singular feverish allure."

   intro: 'The following play reveals the inner monologue of a hot, dry, coastal and Mediterranean region of land that has been ravished by a wildfire. It is divided into several acts. Throughout these acts, the land describes its inner and outer transformation:\n\nThe first act starts like this:\n\n'
   act0descr: 'ACT0: The damage caused by the wildfire is not yet known. The land introduces itself and describes its surroundings.\nLAND:'
   act1descr: 'ACT1: The land is doing fine. Any old burned sections have been absorbed into the soil and act as fertilizer for the burgeoning new tree roots. The land is enhanced by the mere surfacing of its roots. The earth''s desiccation had supplanted the luxurious ecosystem of organisms originally in harmony but now it is in a resurgence. All turns into stillness, and the land whispers in the breeze its generous legacy to the universe, wishing to bloom anew.\nLAND:'
   act2descr: 'ACT2: The land is still doing fine. Any old burned sections are continuing to be absorbed into the soil and are acting as fertilizer for the burgeoning new tree roots. The land is enhanced by the mere surfacing of its roots. The earth''s desiccation had supplanted the luxurious ecosystem of organisms originally in harmony but it is still in a resurgence. All turns into stillness, and the land whispers in the breeze its generous legacy to the universe, wishing to bloom anew.\nLAND:'
   act3descr: 'ACT3: The land is very fragile. It is now growing new roots after a devastating forest fire. The land crumbles towards the formerly moist and fecund terrain. Shreds of ash flicker in the air, making the atmosphere dense with dashed hopes and fading memories. Dreariness has replaced the living spirits, casting its shadow of silence all over the space.\nLAND:'
