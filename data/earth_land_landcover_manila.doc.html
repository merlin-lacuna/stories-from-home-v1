Not everything I once knew has ceased to be: my rivers still run strong, though they are less pure; slender paths of life hum along the thick roots of mighty banyans, linking one trunk to another with a busy traffic in insects and small beings. Seen from space, my white beaches blaze in infrared like expensive brands.<br><br>But I am polluting more than ever before too â far beyond what humans alone can cause or undo. Deforestation is causing me to shed carbon into the atmosphere at a terrific pace: some places here now burn as hot as tropical forests anywhere on Earth. Pollution from cars and cities causes acidification that slowly dissolves my corals â an ongoing destruction visible even from low orbiting spacecraft as ghostly growths erupting beside healthy coralline reefs.<br><br>A ship runs aground on a coral reef near me, where someone leaves behind hundreds of plastic bags heaving with rubbish washed off his boat. This waste spreads all over me often killing predators that seek prey but ingest instead death wrapped in colorless grey.</td>
