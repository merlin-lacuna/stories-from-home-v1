   bio: "In my body, slumbers dormant a fire, a burnt and tainted heart Boiling, smoldering, yearning to awaken. Lands strewn with jagged peaks, black veined forests, veins engorged with life. Within me – fury concealed, beauty manifest My visage, an unquiet elegance; A beast's heart encased in fragile ice. Mysteries flutter down, glistening flakes Filling my world with veils of frozen whispers, white shrouds bind my stifled desire, a shivering dance of fragile existence The trembling embrace of earth and ice. In stillness, dreams gestate Silent, unseen, muffled by a leaden lake of sorrow. Ah! Yet... a gentle touch of fire, a distant warmth, announces the storm to come. The sky wails and thunders, a hundred spectral cries, erupting passion, unraveling the earth Beneath the folds, my heart ignites Breaking through the frosted mantle. Viridian verdure, myriad shades of laughter abound Streamlets shiver, as my blood gushes forth A river of life, burgeoning beneath a canopy, emerald and gold, tearful offerings to the charred soil. On horizons kissed by fiery splendor, my longing quenched, the flame subsided Yet – in the memory of lava, an urge stirred To scorch anew, to love and burn. Thus, I, the land tremble and roar, cloaked in shivering white and fevered black, extremes tethered, within my soul Whisper to me, ye Earthly echoes, of dreams unfettered, in landscape bound."
