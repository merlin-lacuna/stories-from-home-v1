   bio: "As a long corridor, I stretch myself beneath mountains, \nIn the shadow of giants, veined with glacial streams.\nTheir peaks, sculptors of clouds and wind, ascend the heavens, leaving me compressed and forlorn, denied their touch.\nI, land of contrasts and whispers, endure the etchings of the seasons, etched upon my face, an eternal embrace with changing hues, witness to autumn's arrival, rustling a symphony of gold and copper, or the silent shroud of winter, mantling contour and hollow alike.\nMy rivers roar with the fury of melting snows, swift currents coursing through me, urgently seeking seas, nurturing the low-lying vales with their gift of life, creating pastures green amidst my bone-dry plateaus.\nAncient caravans, heavy with silk and spices, once traversed my narrow girth, unaware of my solitude, treading on brittle grasses, hardened hooves imprinting my\nFragile heart, breaking open my resistance.\nThe wind, my sole companion, caresses me with tenderness, caressing the untamed plains with its fickle affections, veering from the harshest gales to a gentle cradle\nThat nestles the snow leopard and Ibex into a calcified reprieve.\nAt night, I dissolve into the vast abyss of darkness, blurring the seams between valley and sky, no beginning, no end, stars leaping from mountain flanks, a dance of celestial fire, only to fade again in dawn’s relentless grip.\nOh, lonely traveler, heed the beauty found within my desolation, within my borders, I hold the shattered fragments of forgotten tales, juxtaposed against the specter of urban idyll—seek not to change me, for in my rugged harshness and windswept terrain, therein lies my spirit."

prompt:
   intro: 'The following play reveals the inner monologue of a dry but fertile, narrow strip of land. It is divided into several acts. Throughout these acts, the land describes its inner and outer transformation:\n\nThe first act starts like this:\n\n'
   act0descr: 'ACT0: The land''s air temperature is not yet known. The land introduces itself and describes its surroundings.\nLAND:'
   act1descr: 'ACT1: The land is unusually moist and lush. It is beginning to attract organisms that do not usually thrive in the land. The land experiences the encounter with an nearly alien element, or at least detects its influence. The aura of water permeates its surface and the humidity gives a glimpse of new horizons, altering its inner landscape.\nLAND:'
   act2descr: 'ACT2: The land is not experiencing anything out of the ordinary. It is dry but not unusually so. It supports a thriving ecosystem. The land nevertheless realises that the sun has always been his constant companion, his guidance, his star and his faith. Perhaps it should once again trust the rays that stroke its sandy surface, however brutally.\nLAND:'
   act3descr: 'ACT3: The land is extremely dry and there is barely any moisture for organisms to survive. The drought of the land is no longer its vital condition, as it no more seems to originate from its very essence, but rather due to unknown and destructive external forces impossible to placate.\nLAND:'
