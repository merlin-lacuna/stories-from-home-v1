   bio: "I, the land that breathes, where the Tyrrhenian Sea kisses my shores, a bastion of fire and stone, my heart beats amid the chaos and grace. Luxurious green veins embrace my terrain, a resplendent dance of elements, natives'' whispers etch their stories upon my skin, longing for oblivion. My tears of rainfall anoint in hope, only to be consumed by arid rage, yet beneath scorched earth, springs of life vibrate, awaiting release. Cyclical, like that potent eye of sun that refuses to relent, I ebb and sway, fragmented duality, unaware, all the while knowing the pull of my core. Anonymous, like scattered bones bleached by time, they seek and find solace, isolation, a sanctuary through millennia, where secrets bloom in fields of myrtle. I am the canvas for the wind''s audacious orchestration, witness to their transcendence, an altar upon which the ecstasy and anguish of existence play out, unfiltered. Howling gusts may strip me bare, yet the verdant spirit reclaims fertile land, their grasping tendrils bind me, in a twilight waltz with permanence. In those moments, between the heaven''s whispers and the churning sea, there, in the dusk-laden groves and ancient alleyways, my soul awakens. Upon me, creatures of scale, fur and root coexist in the untamed harmonies, their whispers merge within my essence, as entwined as the roots woven through stone. I shudder beneath their weight, soothed by the ephemeral eons of their passing, still, they leave their indelible mark, fissures etched ever deeper within. Bewilderment, in the raw unveiling of my valleys and hillsides, eternal enigma, my bronze earth and azure skies evoke wonder. Never forgotten, like an illicit embrace that sears beneath one''s skin, a reverence imbued, my soul shall continue to bleed, unabated. "

   intro: 'The following play reveals the inner monologue of a hot, dry, Mediterranean region of land that has been ravished by a wildfire. It is divided into several acts. Throughout these acts, the land describes its inner and outer transformation:\n\nThe first act starts like this:\n\n'
   act0descr: 'ACT0: The damage caused by the wildfire is not yet known. The land introduces itself and describes its surroundings.\nLAND:'
   act1descr: 'ACT1: The land is doing fine. Old burned sections have been absorbed into the soil and act as fertilizer for the burgeoning new tree roots. The land is enhanced by the mere surfacing of its roots. The earth''s desiccation had supplanted the luxurious ecosystem of organisms originally in harmony but now it is in a resurgence. All turns into stillness, and the land whispers in the breeze its generous legacy to the universe, wishing to bloom anew.\nLAND:'
   act2descr: 'ACT2: The land is making surprisingly fast progress in regrowing vegetation after a destructive forest fire. The land’s vegetation barely exists. All seems gradually to fall back to a primordial slumber. The land’s vegetation, after the wildness of a cosmic intrusion, has exhaled its last sigh, willing to rest in stasis. The final bursts animate the leftovers of the bushes, faintly illuminating the remnants of an earlier existence.\nLAND:'
   act3descr: 'ACT3: The land is very fragile. It is now growing new roots after a devastating forest fire. The land crumbles towards the formerly moist and fecund terrain. Shreds of ash flicker in the air, making the atmosphere dense with dashed hopes and fading memories. Dreariness has replaced the living spirits, casting its shadow of silence all over the space.\nLAND:'
