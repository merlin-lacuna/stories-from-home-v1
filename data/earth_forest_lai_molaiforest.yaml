  act1gen: "Thank God! I am almost dry and clean again, although very bare.  There\

    \ is much of nature's colors that hide on my floor or have escaped into the air.\

    \ That will help Make it a truely beautiful spring once more.... The forest starts\

    \ to notice cyclical transformations within itself and its surroundings - this\

    \ awareness appears to have a restorative effect upon its health: Let me tell\

    \ you briefly what happened here last year. One morning at three o'clock there\

    \ was great commotion over our heads - rustling in the treetops: what could that\

    \ be about? Very well - so we had an improvement for ten days starting from those\

    \ early mornings until half past eleven; such birds as turtledoves, pigeons, crows\

    \ stayed with us twice as long as usual and were noisier than ever before two\

    \ hours earlier each day."

  act2gen: 'I was sitting in darkness for a whole week. The sun shone, sure enough,

    but I saw her neither on the left or the right of me: she completely blinded me

    by hitting my roots straight on and giving them an infernal bath.'

  act3gen: "!!! The birch leaves, can you hear them sing in the wind?! A black bull\

    \ ran by last summer with his horns bolted to a thick bronze ring. ‹Each year\

    \ weaves me tighter still‹ was written on a rock among some ruins in India which\

    \ had been turned into places of faith or stately houses.\n THE HEART DEATH-BLOSSOMED\

    \ MIGHT I be permitted this epiphany? To have loved seems to me now only one single\

    \ thing less than having died for love's sake.... In their place (1 mean here\

    \ neither joy nor bitterness) what do I glimpse as I would like to express it:\

    \ pure beauty and mysterious death: our bodies petrified under the open sky; or\

    \ again, already englobed here below in my heart? Or is that not possible because\

    \ knowledge of love arrives always too late - unless it happens perhaps without\

    \ warning during its troubled fruition itself. (Have l ever met those who are\

    \ so smug they used to maintain that perfect acquaintance occurred before action?)\

    \ But is there really anything more hindered than this fruitless search for truth\

    \ - often but contrarily (to each neighbor)- nevertheless continually advanced\

    \ – especially when backed incessantly -by force ( almost sangfroid)? Wherein\

    \ resides stupidity only if true"
