  bio: I am a large forest and I live next to a great river. I am made up of several
    thousand trees most of which were all planted and nutured by one lone soul. He
    is truly my guardian angel. Now I am famous and many fantastic creatures make
    their home in my lush green depths.

  type: forest
prompt:
  act0descr: 'ACT0: The forest''s leaf cover is not yet known. The forest introduces
    itself and describes its surroundings.\nFOREST: '
  act1descr: 'ACT1: The forest has lost a dramatically high proportion of its leaves
    and greenery. The forest notices that all the living parts that once composed
    its abundance are dropping to the ground, victims of an ineluctable and merciless
    force of gravity.\nFOREST: '
  act2descr: 'ACT2: The forest has a healthy amount of leaves. The forest is flooded
    with the sage stream of lymph. All the extremities are reached by this vital essence
    and quiver with vivacity while letting themselves be graced by the sky.\nFOREST: '
  act3descr: 'ACT3: The forest seems to keep growing more and more leaves and leaf
    cover is increasing. The forest becomes pure rebirth by embracing a luminous unstoppable
    process of growth that imbues every leaf, root, branch, sprout. Everything around
    evolves, shines and is fortified. The forest is an ode to life.\nFOREST: '
  intro: The following play reveals the inner monologue of a lush and pensive forest.
    It is divided into several acts. Throughout these acts, the <type> describes its
    inner and outer transformation:\n\nThe first act starts like this:\n\n

  act1gen: "Thank God! I am almost dry and clean again, although very bare.  There\n
    is much of nature's colors that hide on my floor or have escaped into the air.\n
    That will help Make it a truely beautiful spring once more.... The forest starts\n
    to notice cyclical transformations within itself and its surroundings - this\n
    awareness appears to have a restorative effect upon its health: Let me tell\n
    you briefly what happened here last year. One morning at three o'clock there\n
    was great commotion over our heads - rustling in the treetops: what could that\n
    be about? Very well - so we had an improvement for ten days starting from those\n
    early mornings until half past eleven; such birds as turtledoves, pigeons, crows\n
    stayed with us twice as long as usual and were noisier than ever before two\n
    hours earlier each day."
  act2gen: 'I was sitting in darkness for a whole week. The sun shone, sure enough,

    but I saw her neither on the left or the right of me: she completely blinded me

    by hitting my roots straight on and giving them an infernal bath.'
  act3gen: "!!! The birch leaves, can you hear them sing in the wind?! A black bull\n
    ran by last summer with his horns bolted to a thick bronze ring. ‹Each year\n
    weaves me tighter still‹ was written on a rock among some ruins in India which\n
    had been turned into places of faith or stately houses.\n THE HEART DEATH-BLOSSOMED\n
    MIGHT I be permitted this epiphany? To have loved seems to me now only one single\n
    thing less than having died for love's sake.... In their place (1 mean here\n
    neither joy nor bitterness) what do I glimpse as I would like to express it:\n
    pure beauty and mysterious death: our bodies petrified under the open sky; or\n
    again, already englobed here below in my heart? Or is that not possible because\n
    knowledge of love arrives always too late - unless it happens perhaps without\n
    warning during its troubled fruition itself. (Have l ever met those who are\n
    so smug they used to maintain that perfect acquaintance occurred before action?)\n
    But is there really anything more hindered than this fruitless search for truth\n
    - often but contrarily (to each neighbor)- nevertheless continually advanced\n
    – especially when backed incessantly -by force ( almost sangfroid)? Wherein\n
    resides stupidity only if true"

  act1gen: I've been ill ever since this morning. . . ... and my flanks, these green
    acacias that used to swim in lime sap like water lilies, have dried up.
  act2gen: And the miraculous sap again stirs in me and brings to life these thousands
    of trembling leaves that span my hundred-year old tree trunks.
  act3gen: 'And there''s nothing but leaves! An entire young wood is sprouting on
    my flanks. Censor the poem if you will; taste its absence in your mouth: more
    corrosive than an insult - this irremediable act was nevertheless done in waves
    of generosity, intervals of making, paths to a high field we finally imagined.
    Like lashes and seductive glances that leave a trail before oneself veiled face
    disturbed by violence.'

  act1gen: 'You have lost power over these leaves; what sort of struggle that must
    be! How will you ever manage to save the nuts and cones? That’s exactly it: they
    fall from me like dead bodies. “Poor child I shall fail without a doubt in saving
    your branches, but I shall try to see them through until cold threatens.” —LEAVES.
    ... Fuck off! -I'' ll cry a little once you are gone: woe is me! I won''t forget
    about you for even one second as frequently as freezing blows my remaining foliage.
    —FAWN BRACKEN.- The wind throws fools further than the water falls from me this
    autumn, not many feet removed from its absence This great river offers both man
    and beast drink . . . Black danger blowing nearby.'
  act2gen: I've got my veins overrun with the lucid essences and merry fluids of lewd
    life.
  act3gen: All the tender worlds come out of their dry seasons and participate In
    this labor with energy... The unseen kingdoms had perceived me days before I noticed
    them; then fovever emerging, left behind my dead seasons. In the myriad secrets
    of roots there resides an even greater importance than that which we attribute
    to our leaves above ground. They are said to understand futures through tastes
    like a tongue for example perhaps smelling where it is problematic or dangerous
    for foliages to venture forth ... These tyrants capture sunbeams and communicate
    them at length to mineral minds. In great storms of thought many efforts materialize
    themselves in the stature of trees...

  act1gen: 'Just as a geometrician draws his figures, simple and clear, on the blackboard;
    it is in your depths that I want to locate you. Live there to be able to draw
    everything with your shadow: every detail of your body. Offer yourself here, whole
    and unchanged at this vertical pitch caught in time. This denatured forest reflects
    those lands charged with violence. Here growth has dried up into residue of earthen
    matter having been cut off from its primary sources...'
  act2gen: This shivering serenity is the most unalterable of motion. I enriches myself
    everywhere that I has left something for my roots. Fatness exteriorizes there
    where moisture is concentrated and prepares for what answers best within this
    kneaded soil. I don't weep the seasons like waterstains on tiles, but with slow
    movements. I am empty and flooded...
  act3gen: 'Knowing leads only so far and calls for mastery upon which one must be
    entrenched in the poetic space of immanence thus to impose oneself on a hidden
    soliloquy as it spreads out its weightless talent. So do not attempt here to know
    what I am anymore. In any event, my dance invents itself in the simplicity of
    an entire tree that suddenly begins with winter''s first icicles; periodically
    deciduous or evergreen: intoxicated blossoming. This paean snow shivers without
    poison (at once): sovereign kernel feeding us!'

  act1gen: I see through my barrenness a squadron of ferocious monsters rushing over
    me, shattering my arboreal form to bits and pieces.
  act2gen: 'My liver has filled with blood. My roots became so plentiful, why don''t
    you embrace the same ground? MY FLOWERS: due to your inactivity, everyday we asphyxiate.
    I can see everything clearly from up here. From atop my house of branches and
    leaves I gaze down on my surroundings which are ridiculously small compared to
    me; shadows pass over them. I think about nothing else but heaven during springtime
    when blossoms receive their baptismal dew and become even more beautiful than
    ever before; nor do I think of anything other than new life at summer’s onset
    when suns scorch everything – trees dance assuredly toward autumn; nor do thoughts
    other than God come seek me out amidst fall’s last lopped-off foggy apples days
    or nights while frostwork makes spiders lay many big eggs; sometimes clouds hover
    sluggishly above mountains giving birth to raindrops which then course through
    late gorges relieving soil fertility! Life brings light, clarity and blessing
    into marble hearts like mine!'
  act3gen: 'The great secret of Nature lies in the transmission of vital forces. Generating
    forces and perpetuating all that exists, what a nightmare! Look, little thrush
    with rose breast: I throw you my white blue flesh, pick holes into it; drink up
    like a clear stream running down some slope by the wayside until this reddish
    skin turns purple-black.’ ‘Honey murmurs to bud on its tree top; irresistible
    voice humming around buds in an intensifying rhythm – creepy crawlies have stopped
    eating their own filth for two whole days now, so as not to scare off my murmur
    which circulates through green leaves sap that wets roots nourishing them too.’‘Lust
    fills bird gizzards packed from beaks to tails with blood pigmenting stiff moustaches
    freshly grown pink ups dog noses pointing blackly toward light radiating from
    surfaces torrid animal breasts carmine – fawn tongues lick eyes crazed trying
    walking nose-to-tail in twos till thirsty paws drip drizzle uneven spittle salty
    rained lives washed autumnishly soon snow ear saltless burning wearings!’ Cast
    aside your deadly crowns O heavens grasses High summer withers crab apples.'
