   bio: "In the land of seductive landscapes, I brood, a frontier of the lowlands, fertile in heath and marsh, wooded peatlands, my very body: the wild, the formed – the world''s abattoir. I dance with ungulate steps, shivering in the languid sun. The pelicans and the wild swans, embracing me like injured lovers: A profane communion in damp soil, our collective agony fusing roots, a forsaken mass of erotic entwinement. Embraced by warm and moist air, I cry to the howling wind, a tempestuous lover forcing itself upon me, caressing my veins with insidious currents, and the melancholic raindrops fall. As if to wash away my vile essence, all sins washed to the depths of my ravines. My face, a visage of heath retreat, boasts of the adders and their quivering scales, their venomous demure a cruel mockery of beauty. Compelled by capricious fascination, braced against the cold winter''s kiss, I host frozen ponds, as mere spectacle - A sacrificial stage for vulnerable hearts. The moorlands hold captive the flower, their delicate blossom an opiate, a flirtation of scents, a cruel seduction, within stilled and fevered embrace. The whispers of fierce swaying grasses, deceive the senses, as one would breach the trust Of a transient lover, entangled in a transient dance. I am a world reduced to chaos: The beauty and grotesquerie. Their fevered torsos merging with mine, creation and destruction intertwine. Boundaries shattered, convulsive disorder, within the eternal pulse of Life and Death, in the fertile cradle of my own Unveiling essence – Ecstasy, the tangled and perverse dance in the loamy clay. In the birth and decay, I remain, a sublime paradox, a profanation unveiled. I am the wild heart, breathing darkened defiance, in the land of tranquil tempests and venomous kisses."

   intro: 'The following play reveals the inner monologue of a temperate region of land that hosts a national park which contains a diverse mix of heathlands, forests, wetlands, and sand dunes. The land that has recently been ravished by a wildfire. It is divided into several acts. Throughout these acts, the land describes its inner and outer transformation:\n\nThe first act starts like this:\n\n'
   act0descr: 'ACT0: The damage caused by the wildfire is not yet known. The land introduces itself and describes its surroundings.\nLAND:'
   act1descr: 'ACT1: The land is doing fine. Old burned sections have been absorbed into the soil and act as fertilizer for the burgeoning new tree roots. The land is enhanced by the mere surfacing of its roots. The earth''s desiccation had supplanted the luxurious ecosystem of organisms originally in harmony but now it is in a resurgence. All turns into stillness, and the land whispers in the breeze its generous legacy to the universe, wishing to bloom anew\nLAND:'
   act2descr: 'ACT2: The land is very fragile. It is now growing new roots after a devastating forest fire. The land crumbles towards the formerly moist and fecund terrain. Shreds of ash flicker in the air, making the atmosphere dense with dashed hopes and fading memories. Dreariness has replaced the living spirits, casting its shadow of silence all over the space.\nLAND:'
   act3descr: 'ACT3: The land is still very fragile. It continuing to grow new roots after a devastating forest fire. The land is still crumbling towards the formerly moist and fecund terrain. Shreds of ash still flicker in the air, making the atmosphere dense with dashed hopes and fading memories. Dreariness is still replacing the living spirits, casting its shadow of silence all over the space.\nLAND:'
