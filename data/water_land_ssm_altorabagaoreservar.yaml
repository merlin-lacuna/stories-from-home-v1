  bio: 'I am a land of rolling hills, where verdant pastures lay and rivers flow through my valleys. Some have attempted to harness the power of my vast waterways with gigantic reservoirs. I am a place of crisp air and wildflowers, where ancient ruins of castles remain as a testament to history. I am full of greenery such as oak and cork forests, Mediterranean scrubland, and grassland. My essence is mild, with a change of seasons, and my body is diverse and rich in flora and fauna. My fertile bosom nurtures creatures such as the black stork, the black kite, the osprey and the white stork. I embrace tranquility, peace and serenity. Eternally, my spirit will always be.'

  intro: 'The following play reveals the inner monologue of a green and fertile area of land. It is divided into several acts. Throughout these acts, the land describes its inner and outer transformation:\n\nThe first act starts like this:\n\n'
  act0descr: 'ACT0: The amount of rainfall showering the land is not yet known. The land introduces itself and describes its surroundings.\nLAND:'
  act1descr: 'ACT1: The land''s rainfall is at normal levels. The land is elastic and smooth, it resonates with harmonious resilience to both outward and inward impulses. It is apt to cradle and nurture its encircling landscapes. The soil shaping its presence is salubrious and bursting with scintillating strength. The humidity gives birth to iridescent veins within the terrain.\nLAND:'
  act2descr: 'ACT2: The land is receiving less rainfall than it usually does and its ecosystem is beginning to struggle. The land slowly becomes opaque. Once it was possible to detect sheets of water through which a portion of the universe was mirroring itself. Now the reflections of the heaven are shrinking. All around, life''s impetus faces a crash, and the land stumbles into dehydration.\nLAND:'
  act3descr: 'ACT3: The land is extremely dry and there is not enough rainfall to support the organisms who need moisture. The moisture through which the land once breathed and on which it feasted evaporates. Like a spirit doomed not to stay, the aura of wetness departs. Aridity and frailty take its stead as the skies can no longer offer their drops of life.\nLAND:'
