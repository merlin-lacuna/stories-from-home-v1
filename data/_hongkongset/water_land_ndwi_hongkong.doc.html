It is a voluptuous equilibrium that finds its place among the surroundings: earth, water, wind and plants.<br><br>The masses are often afraid they might have insufficient spiritual nutrition to survive; thus they seek things wrongly. They dream of leaving their age behind in order utterly to transform it. As if one could escape in time! How much effort must there not be when everything here below has already been spent on analogous worries?</td>

        <td>The anfractuosities of my hills mingle with the reflections in my pools, creating perfect mirrors for saddened and deserted expanses … Far from being adequate to form a nation and succeed as such, I nonetheless have become fertile ground for humanity&#x27;s diverse madnesses: emigration was born here; trade and manufacturing grew here … Severe plagues were easily buried along the foul or stagnant entranceways to this grotesque labyrinth. Here popular uprisings raged endlessly. We opened our clean arms toward impoverished immigrant hordes that robbed us of part of our own genetics while searching out some better future (and ended up merely serving as fodder on the fields around us). Yet how easily one forgets what is directly before one!</td>

The empires that shattered elsewhere can never crush me properly … My rivers of tears bury their tragedy inside themselves and fall slowly into the South China Sea at last. Here funerary urns lie prostrate in scattered deposits amongst vibrant ruins veiled from us by noble desuetude.</td>

Though I am relatively ill used, countries far away stretch out their fingers towards me and kiss this virgin realm … Here streets become clean cutting pathways; shops with modern metal shutters spring up along previously bare routes; tall columns of smoke rise up into the hesitant light from new factories, workshops where men in white coats work attentively at machines … My life is portentous because it makes others happy anew … Nature rose up against us: tragic plagues reached laughable proportions and outdid us in panic. We got richer by our shudders which shook down deluges onto us again and again … The sacred right of giving oneself whatever death one fancies coupled very well with our unjustified sense of security in playing a useful role within humanity&#x27;s great game enmeshing everything divined by clairvoyance between chancel- leries and banks, emporia gangs!</td>
