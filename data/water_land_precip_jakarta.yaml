    bio: "I am the mountain that whispers secrets, hidden in the crevices of my slopes, my soul woven with the threads of the eternal, a silent witness to cycles of life and decay. Silhouettes of my shadows cast upon the verdant plains, as the sun climbs and descends my contours, the celestial dance of light and dark.  Cool winds pirouette around me, weaving stories of an ephemeral climate, stirring the souls of those who dare to venture into my embrace. Unquenchable thirst quelled by the tears of monsoon's despair, and in their wake - a lush quilt of moss, ferns, and tendrils unfurling.  A myriad of living hues unfold within my chest, emerging from the fertile soils, the progeny of ancient volcanic dreams. The tenacious trees cloak my spine, armor against the ravages of time, unseen and unheard, a quiet cacophony thrives in my verdant heart.  I cradle life within my bosom, a trembling symphony of flora and fauna, the primordial orchestra of avian songs and insect chatter. My lungs nourish the vibrant tapestry of life, alight with fireflies, illuminating the nocturnal serenade.  As the morning mist pirouettes upon my unseen smile, the twilight dew weeps, caressing my roots with its transient presence, a tender transient love, clouds wrap my peak, veiling my summit like a coy bride amidst a celestial waltz, swirling whispers of the universe that reside in me, a silent communion.  The sacred union of heavens and earth manifests in my existence, my essence, etching an indelible bond with the passage of time. My breath merges with the elements, intermingling with the cosmic dance, an inseparable link to the primordial forces, making me whole.  I am the mountain, the keeper of secrets, the sovereign of a fragrant, emerald kingdom, transcending the boundaries of time and space in my eternal embrace."
