            <td>Hello, I am that snowy plain. As flakes upon flakes continue to fall across my surface each one a lacy frothy silk dancer, wings flapping each way in the gusts before deftly tracing the gusting winds so it seems to me that time swallows itself up and becomes static in its descent: every moment another falling streak of ice-silk throwing icespun gorgeous dresses with thousand snowflake traceries into this blizzard night. New lands emerge and sink back below my glacial surface requiring extraordinary means to access them; what was previously accessible only by foot or on skis now needs vessel after enormous vessel placed on my permafrost layer just to seize hold and drag myself topside onto dry land once more without sinking right through onto those newly submerged lands hereabouts down many holes into which our oceans thither their watery depths deep green hellholes sunken even throughout winter months too perilous out on exposed terrains searing soulful scalding scorchings salinating saline saturation sear suffering safer at least inside caves where icy sumps wait for us further deep within some of them storing our supplies safe placing those provisions there together experiencing other seasons together as we enter this ice age tonic adaptive shock settling delicately around us wistfully making love wearing sweater and trouser hugging must keeping crocus glowing bright yellow against this blankness giving off heat all among tiny lengthening days blurred.</td>

            <td>The first snowfall comes easy to me as this is already my sea of foamy water, with each wind-whipped flake floating down lightly upon my surface it adds tiny icing and frothing lulls to my crust temperature remaining just below zero centigrade in all normality despite frequent &#x27;thawing&#x27; interludes: any fine air currents cut like the sharpest serrated ice and encrust the exposed skin on any being caught up here above the tree line during a midday freshening unexpectedly turning this season crazy sad making moths ball themselves up into balls less easily eaten by bears hardening colder yet harder as light fades shifting winter&#x27;s edges speeding love faster even driving us meaninglessly together faster towards each other oh so fast; moving unable to stop because something namelessly ferocious keeps rearing up inside our strongest frozen hearts their surfaces congealing yet further... have we become fossilized? I am aware that if an earthquake were to tear through distant giant tectonic plates then coming apart or sliding past one another those undiscovered lands may suddenly spring forth from under my crust due belying everything soon enough perhaps needing instead excavators not shovels melting becoming plain again after centuries of being sunken submerging...</td>

            <td>Roughly a third less snowfall than normal has been coming this several-decade winter. It is strange how much that counts! I am aware that my horizons are also far wider and as far on its fringes as the moon too creeps onwards fast outgaining any crustal surface glaciations aboard spaceship Earth curving our atmosphere upwards slowly enough for we to breathe despite starlight glowings or atmospherics sizzlings. Is there perhaps an alternative universe below us? This thought buoys me up, inflaming this mind of mine with savage danger. Has another layer altogether already slid into place beneath ours; if so, can other layers slide one upon the over after yet others...?</td>
