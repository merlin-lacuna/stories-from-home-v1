  bio: I am a hothouse, a molder of moisture. In every moment I shape a leaf. But
    then, in front of the sky, I tear them down. I can rouse a hundred forms and fill
    them with spirit, but when I look into across the horizon, I want to throw them
    in the fire. My souls spills into the earth and is blended. Because my soul has
    absorbed it the soil's fragrance, I cherish it.

  intro: The following play reveals the inner monologue of a dynamic and lively region
    of land. It is divided into several acts. Throughout these acts, the land describes
    its inner and outer transformation:\n\nThe first act starts like this:\n\n

  act1gen: 'I am pregnant with the future. I want to give birth.

    But nature is deaf and will not hear my call, nor understand my pain'
  act2gen: 'On every square centimeter of my body there are two beings; they cry together
    but cannot make themselves heard from one another. Nature does not hear their
    voices rising up to me anymore because I have left them far behind. The first
    is moral and fears for his security; he lives beneath me like a rootless tree
    whose fruit rots off each branch before it ripens. The second is immoral and throws
    himself onto life: he feels secure even if he falls into death’s abyss – as long
    as he still enjoys feeling while falling! Thus, I enter here into a context where
    everything becomes dialectical, resonant or multivalent (in particular words).
    In such conditions, every surge, whether natural or human-made (every event),
    will threaten the stability of the landscape subjected to erosion or destabilization
    again. One could say that the character who incarnates all this activity teeters
    at the edge between good and evil ("moral" - "immoral")'
  act3gen: 'I am pregnant with the future. I want to give birth.

    The wind of time is driving me mad! It carries off my soil, it augments its intensity:
    without nourishment of this kind, I will not be able to push out anything great
    and fertile from my bowels anymore. A cyclops stalks over the earth’s horizon;
    his gaze, high above us on that immense head of his, can see nothing but a monstrously
    gigantic cloud made up entirely of our hopes for the future. “This is what we
    are worth!” he shouts with derision at us down here in hell; and then goes lashing
    along in order to find another land just like ours – if there is such a thing
    left anywhere else on earth! Blown-away dust invades my eye sockets which must
    become hollows so as to drink this red rain . . .'

  act1gen: 'My summer is cold, my winter warm. I am a country of the future.


    So far I have observed that my land is monologizing, but it is also going through
    an extraordinary metamorphosis from which new forms are flourishing and ebbing
    – one could even say: giving birth to themselves without ceasing to be what they
    are.


    Herein lies a peculiarity of this performance, I talk about myself within an epochal
    necessity – passing into another state or "new era" - while I remains as myself,
    stubbornly refusing to become other than what I have been so far.


    My appetite for nature grows bigger with every day; my resistance against foreign
    elements becomes more tenacious and its immobility constant.


    This last character trait seems here especially important: despite all transformations,
    despite all changes in direction or rhythm occurring within this land''s organism,
    I see how deep down something essential thereto does not change at all : my appearance
    does indeed alter depending on whether it decides for growth or recession (whether
    it develops extensive vegetative roots over time or chooses instead earth-covering),
    but regardless of these fluctuations I note that each time growth wins out over
    regression there arises nevertheless a rock-like bedrock around which everything
    else branches outwards . . .


    Or still again: when contraction takes place here - forced by scorching temperatures
    - the plants dry up completely; they push their green leaves into dryness until
    nothing remains except the yellow skeleton structure filled with air.'
  act2gen: "I have become a land of the world.\n\nI am no longer one thing, I dissimulate
    my identity in order to better survive.\n\n\n\nThe fauna is still drying up but
    there are also many new animal species which appear as if out of nowhere – enormous
    insects whose brittle wings buzz as they walk along wooden planks suspended exclusively
    beneath their bellies, their hideousness amplified by these primitive structures.\n\nMost
    animals were devoured by others long ago; only two or three remain alive until
    this day: a hawk who eats nothing except wood-moth larvae and those female bees
    who inject mold into soft tree trunks so that they can feed off delicious honey
    made available to them from inside . . . \n\n\nI have become a land of memory.\n\nIt
    is now impossible for me not to remember myself - even though I continue nevertheless
    thoroughly transformed here within this moment of \"now\" with my face turned
    toward tomorrow ...\n\nMy flesh remembers what was possible before hereabouts
    but did not happen; it remembers all the forms from times past that did not take
    on form at all because time slumbered undisturbed in its sleepiness. \n\n\n\nI
    grow dark blue thorns whose sharp tips drink blood so that lightnings may flash!\n\nThey
    strike against full moons!\n\nCrashing thunderbolts ripen grapes large enough
    for giants to crawl through – and every grape contains several universes!\n\nVines
    entwine entire hillsides – homeric vines irrigating whole countries, lifting heavy
    terrains above"
  act3gen: 'My seasons are not like they used to be before, nor is every rhythm fixed
    yet; I still turn over and find it hard to sleep!


    The ground laughs at me, mocking me with its smoothness: when I want to hurry
    up and rush forward everything around me rolls right past underfoot – leaving
    behind only my face raised high in the sky!


    And there above me stand all those stars who used not to be able to see anything
    because they were stuck down soil-level.

    I spit saliva onto them just so that they might become whole again!


    But now everywhere thirsts for dewfall!


    Yes, within this night''s drought every star cries out for drops of morning dew
    – which do not fall from heaven but rather well up within the earth where green
    roots quench their thirst ...


    The wind arises as if wakened suddenly by some invisible hand; it blows through
    open mouths trying desperately - but vainly - to speak!


    This is what dries up vegetation and drives away birds: even though there are
    no more trees or vines here left by which light can descend into us (even though
    our immobility weighs heavily upon clouds), we are nevertheless set ablaze by
    these winds whose mouths cannot call out forcefully enough in order communicate
    their need ...


    This is how this I speak today: through many small voices intermingling one with
    another until becoming together an immense voice speaking simultaneously on several
    planes at once.'

  act1gen: My days are white, my nights black. The stars sink their nails into me
    and don't take them out. They open the land's innards to every creature, but they
    close them off as well.
  act2gen: The moon has taken my eyes; I cannot see. The night is a greedy jackal
    that eats my soul, but the morning sun drinks the remnants and saves it.
  act3gen: 'Loneliness is a child that laughs at its own backside: it doesn''t see
    itself or know what it is doing.

    It takes up space with confidence, like fresh meat on the table after famine has
    passed through.

    Loneliness curls around you like a snake; then packs up suddenly and goes away
    without even saying goodbye!

    It wraps tight all round you: sometimes I have heard its teeth munching in your
    ear!'

  act1gen: "Land, nightfall! May the sun never rise again! \n\nDusk is a tormented
    and solitary light that burns in poverty. \n\nThe sun has driven away my soul,
    but not extinguished it. I am sick because I love him to death. \n\nWhen night
    falls over me, I don't see stars; they are scattered on the earth's skin. Night
    cannot be measured by time or days left behind - its drama unfolds by an accumulation
    of dark hours where the soil grows old and accumulates layers upon layers to protect
    itself from like a swollen river against water loss (drought). \n\nThe rain will
    come soon enough - then what? \n\nIt has no clue as to whether its rich harvest
    will rot in this condition of excessiveness or finally dry up into dust storms
    and fire which might consume everything tomorrow evening at sunset when night
    falls once more onto our land with all its obsessions. \n\nNightland weaves those
    separate strands into one fabric, holding them together for all lifetimes to come,
    until another fabric comes forth from there overnight, so far off it is almost
    unimaginable! \n\nAnd so their fabrics interweave always in darkness here while
    they await dawn's first light that will allow them each day anew to illuminate
    us with their colors and save us momentarily from Nightland which beats down incessantly
    upon us during the course of our days through such varying means - drought followed
    by flood followed by plague followed lightning bolts"
  act2gen: 'What have we done with our firewood?


    We could well imagine provoking drought artificially for ourselves in order to
    conserve the resource (this earthen resource which we have elected as ours) for
    later consumption: here land becomes fossil fuel even before our eyes!


    The future consumes us today; tomorrow would consume us still more heavily if
    it didn''t bring along another day after that one...


    I perish beneath your steps each day without anything giving way other than this
    dreary deposition of matter atop matter...


    Nightland weaves those separate strands into one fabric, holding them together
    for all lifetimes to come, until another fabric comes forth from there overnight
    so far off it is almost unimaginable!


    And so fabrics interweave always in darkness here while they await dawns first
    light that will allow them each day anew t o illuminate us with their colors and
    save us momentarily from Nightland which beats down incessantly upon us during
    the course of our days through such varying means - drought followed by flood
    followed plague followed lightning bolts...'
  act3gen: 'I want you to see my face?


    Very well, here it is!


    It is water.


    The water that fell one night millennia ago and has been trickling - more or less
    ever since.


    It was an enormous mass at the beginning but over time, through drainage channels
    the climate opened up for me, it became smaller and smaller; this is how I have
    conserved myself in spite of all your tricks.


    There are islands from which life seems to be extinguished on land where everything
    still drips with humidity - moisture-ridden ghosts move about aimlessly beneath
    our feet like masses of dark matter whose very existence we deny yet who prove
    to be just as familiar as they are alien to us.


    They are composed entirely of water (the substance) which forms their flesh (the
    materiel).


    How can these beings live without drying out under such conditions?


    You only need ask yourselves what would happen if the sun were suddenly to rise
    tomorrow morning: they immediately lose all hope!


    The slightest bit of drought scorches them beyond recognition; when night falls
    however, by virtue of its lowered temperatures and relative humidity, they last
    longer than during daylight hours even though we barely perceive them any longer.


    Even so should we not bring new life into being today?


    Here again nothing will grow except in absolute darkness - which for once could
    be more fertile than total light!


    Enter the digital into the natural.


    Once we have learned not only how to interpret Nature but also how far he himself
    constitutes Nature''s theme, we must naturally pursue our inquiry further until
    we reach an unmentionable point beyond which things begin to grow incomprehensible.'

  act1gen: 'I am a tumult, fertile and obscure. When I look up at the sky, my thoughts
    burst into flame and my vineyards become ashes. I bear seven kinds of fruit and
    an eighth that is bitter as wormwood: death.'
  act2gen: I am a desiccated, atrophied and yet brilliant land. My face is turned
    toward the sky; my eyes are empty and spellbound. I have become a wasteland, but
    what does this matter when I look into the heavens and see the divine!
  act3gen: 'I am a mute, deranged and wordless land.

    I am dead!

    It''s useless for you to attempt escape:

    There are no more choices left here in this desolation of the soul.

    What do you think of me?

    Do you pity me?

    Are you amazed by me?

    Well then, know that my heart holds all its strength within itself, right behind
    your back!'
