  bio: "In the throes of self-woven mists I dwell, a vibrant paradise kissed by azure skies. Do not enshrine me in words, for they quell The throbbing, vast expanse these eyes belies. \nBehold the orchids! A myriad's bloom, concealed within their petals, siren songs. Yet kept in secret, lest impending doom Silence their fragrant, life-bestowing throngs. \nThy tide encroaches, ebbs and seeks retreat, nurturing respite in this haven's tangle. Seafarers, take heed: their leviathan's fleet Surges and sinks, a symphony's faring jangle. \nBy celestial design or capricious dance, 'Round steep escarpments, waters shall converge. Bereaved apparitions from collective trance Cascading in torrent, mother's white dirge. \nEffervescent rain exalts nostrils' scent, each breath punctuated by humid embrace. Manifest, in blushing dawns that ascend, adorning the canvas of ashen-faced space. \nOur siblings, the palms, who stand for eons, drinking the sustenance the heavens provide: With graceful bows before the gusts' pleadings, their fronds bear witness to stories untied. \nCountless voices meld in eon's choir, dense quivering canopy untamed, like flame. Murmurs, trilling strands of passion's fire, each verse in harmony, their worlds proclaim. \nAn ensign of luminous tapestry, vibrant hues stroked on boundless staccato. The silken-veiled audacity Each dawn bestowed, timeless legato. \nIn the throes of dawn's embrace, here does cease The incandescent struggle in which we toil. This fervent poem, composed of nature's peace Still reaches out to the realm from the soil."
