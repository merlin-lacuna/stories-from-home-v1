To have loved seems to me now only one single<br> thing less than having died for love&#x27;s sake.... In their place (1 mean here<br> neither joy nor bitterness) what do I glimpse as I would like to express it:<br> pure beauty and mysterious death: our bodies petrified under the open sky; or<br> again, already englobed here below in my heart? Or is that not possible because<br> knowledge of love arrives always too late - unless it happens perhaps without<br> warning during its troubled fruition itself. (Have l ever met those who are<br> so smug they used to maintain that perfect acquaintance occurred before action?)<br> But is there really anything more hindered than this fruitless search for truth<br> - often but contrarily (to each neighbor)- nevertheless continually advanced<br> – especially when backed incessantly -by force ( almost sangfroid)?
