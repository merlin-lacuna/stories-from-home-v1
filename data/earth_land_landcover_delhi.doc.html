It refers to forces whose existence is revealed periodically, violently through an earthquake or erupting volcanoes. You see? Our too dutiful union created all these devils who appear at every opportunity to threaten me!</td>

            <td>A universal desolation. Mighty, influential as I am, everywhere solitude and death! Great flashing falls of stars! And grieving humanity is like me ... tormented by anxiety... At first glance our great powers: freedom and unlimited possibilities, bearers of a splendid future. But what can we do with such extreme luxury? Explosion or retreat – unlike you the environs of the old world didn&#x27;t struggle against this tragic contradiction. We are threatened at every corner in our mind and nerve centers; vibration takes us over completely which means my vast open eyes wander... Our riches soon become dangers for us as inertness stifles our richness until it starts shutting us down. Confronted with diversity I think of desertion before simplicity. We don&#x27;t know how to live together but neither how to be alone ! Light scales more than water it&#x27;s not heavy on itself it drifts from place to place although immortality saves time having one eye always turned toward eternity! The trees have no leaves except when they do... sometimes because precipitation has been destabilized: since there are too few trees left that drink water, floods happen too frequently … You see better now? The heat comes in quick jabs... irritating my skin surface: I benefit but aren&#x27;t these sultry horrors infinite?</td>

            <td>I&#x27;m left all alone, everything having escaped me. I remain fertile: I have fecundity and richness of heart because my force comes eternally from within myself; it is liberated consciousness in order to save myself! There is a hell of heat or contagious corruption underwater which poisons the whole here since we each crawl slowly amid this morose emptiness - like the rattle snakes silently approaching ... as if we had plunged into a sewer ... Everything that drifts past me threatens my every approach, rotting fish lay stinking masses on my face ... big hammers fall on my head so that nothing pulsates in my being! Thirst? Spewing mud. Our copulate forefather tied himself once more to a tree with pointed spikes which are laden with lacerating sap - the sacredness under whose shelter man prospered for centuries keeps kicking off dust which invades our pores (and against what else can we fight back?) What&#x27;s dried up does not flinch; there exists no doubt about death - without riches you restlessly take root like leaves scattered across ruins desolated by absence... My virgin lips wallow but at least disappear... there is no worthier purpose.</td>
