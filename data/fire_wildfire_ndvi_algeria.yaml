   bio: "Abyssal solitude encompasses me, bereft of geographic name, no claim to fame. The waves I taste, a union of earth and sea, bound by tender whispers of forgotten tales. No verses rhyme within this pulsating heart, beating with the unspoken tales of ancient tribes who roamed their souls, woven among jagged shores - Resting their dreams in caverns, songs echo still. From my bosom emerge tendrils of life, caressed by violent winds, tearing my breast, their gory roots entangled in limestone''s womb, ever seeking refuge from slumbering hillsides. My daughters, olive-skinned with daring shades, soft rebellions against the sun''s golden shackle. Floating upon goat paths like the scent of jasmine, loved by men of salt and sweat, whose gazes sweat desire. A fervid sun burns love into my drying whines, a dance upon my arid face offering sweet release. For such is my nature, untamed and unchained, a storm unbridled, a force of creation no name shall tame. No calendar shall bind me, have I not known? The exuberance of spring and winter''s despair, autumn''s surrender while summer reigns relentless, yet tempestuous beauty has not bent me to submission. Heed, I beseech thee, to the secrets of my soil, where the land is quenched, the souls do not awaken. Deep wells flowing through the subterranean veins, torrents cascading in infinite embrace. Silent watchers loom along my jagged breast, wind-kissed Kabylie mountains, fierce and proud, guarding the sacred thread of my existence, ever twisting, stretching, reaching for the sun. Mark these words, dear wanderer, filled with compassion, lay bare your ego, for I shall whisper only once, listen now, with your heart attuned to the shivering sands, i am but a fragment of the world, a universe within a pebble."

   intro: 'The following play reveals the inner monologue of a hot, dry, Mediterranean region of land that has been ravished by a wildfire. It is divided into several acts. Throughout these acts, the land describes its inner and outer transformation:\n\nThe first act starts like this:\n\n'
   act0descr: 'ACT0: The damage caused by the wildfire is not yet known. The land introduces itself and describes its surroundings.\nLAND:'
   act1descr: 'ACT1: The land is doing fine. Any old burned sections have been absorbed into the soil and act as fertilizer for the burgeoning new tree roots. The land is enhanced by the mere surfacing of its roots. The earth''s desiccation had supplanted the luxurious ecosystem of organisms originally in harmony but now it is in a resurgence. All turns into stillness, and the land whispers in the breeze its generous legacy to the universe, wishing to bloom anew.\nLAND:'
   act2descr: 'ACT2: The land is making surprisingly fast progress in regrowing vegetation after a destructive forest fire. The land’s vegetation barely exists. All seems gradually to fall back to a primordial slumber. The land’s vegetation, after the wildness of a cosmic intrusion, has exhaled its last sigh, willing to rest in stasis. The final bursts animate the leftovers of the bushes, faintly illuminating the remnants of an earlier existence.\nLAND:'
   act3descr: 'ACT3: The land has barely started to recover from a disastrous forest fire. The land senses that its plants are suffocating, surrounded by a thick, opaque haze. The fume mantle is apparently bent on no longer allowing the sunlight to reach its forest''s previously lush extensions. Everything grows fuzzy, the trunks creak at the dawn of an impending end.\nLAND:'
