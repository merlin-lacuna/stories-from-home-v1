   bio: "I, the eternal crux, woven in being, bemisted dream, whence panoplies unfold.\nMine breath commingles: snaking currents lift, far-flung the gossamer, from stinging cheeks, and raven tarns where spectral motes distil.\nThe shimmering air rests upon my breast;\nAlone through cloud and gale, unworn by time, as arbiter of ancient winds, I hold, with snow-crystalled fingers, orchestrations\nOf ceaseless thunder and susurrant breeze.\nUpon mine etched form, rain-argent cascades, my limbs enshrouded under jewelled ice, within these depths eternal strangers dwell:\nThe prancing Monal, feathered radiant robes, i gentled host within my glacial womb.\nWhere heights beget the mottled rhododendron, i cradle life, at once both gnarled and fragile, my sides traverse the boundary between, the realm of man and landscapes left untouched, an axis drawn until the end of days.\nIn frost's embrace, I witness fleeting years;\nThe moon's celestial passage now the same, as human footfalls alone fell upon me\nIn search of truths beyond celestial grasp.\nMine voice exhales the harbingers of change.\nA pinnacle resolute 'gainst the skies, i trace the veins that write and rewrite lives, the water's song upon my weathered folds, a symphony to orchestrate the dawn\nOf greening earth and life in quiet throes."
