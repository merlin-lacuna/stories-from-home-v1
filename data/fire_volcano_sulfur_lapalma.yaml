   bio: "I, land of eternal paradox, smoke flits across my body, heralding the obscure flare of my mornings. Ecstatic streams of black veins, caressing my undulating ruggedness, lava from soulful abyss, awake with fervent lust. I am consumed by myself and memories, dying phoenixes enveloped in mist, sighs of relics from voluptuous seabed. A palette of resplendent hues, stains of life, whispers amidst forgotten laurel forests, wrapped in sylvan melancholy, a fever dream. Harbinger winds sighed from the abyss, carrying secrets on their caustic wings, kissing my enamored craters, guarded By dragon trees' tearful embrace. My heart throbs, viscerally, pulse shuddering beneath the soil, awakening the roots, seeking holiness, blessing the ashen fingertips of the pines. Above me, the sun, a capricious goddess, veils herself with amorphous veils, waxing, waning, brazen and treacherous, defier of the limits of my desires. Shroud of stars piercing the night sky, I am death, cosmic resurrection, an acute gasp, ecstasy upturned, an eternal, boundless, unapologetic plight. My body, sanctuary for wild souls, my passions unravel within tangled cliffs, seeking solace in labyrinths of solitude A haunting melody of chaos and beauty intertwines. I am not an island in name, I am the intimate stranger's kiss, a celestial voice, wrapped in terrestrial paradox, i, a fierce burning pyre of yearning, forever reaching, aching, yearning, bound endlessly to the coarse salted embrace of the sea."
