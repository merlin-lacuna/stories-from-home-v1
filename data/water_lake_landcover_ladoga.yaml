  bio: "Here are my long winters and cool summers. I spread them out like fine pond weed, icy water, salty tears and wet glistening fish in foamy lakes. I show you the detail, the contours of my vast coastline, the shimmer of my rippled surface. Empty your curdled thoughts. Spill your tears. That hard nugget of ice. I would suck it cradling it on the lakeside like the slick scales of trout. I would lift it tenderly as a hungry bird might carry a small one in its nest tucked into the reeds on the lakeside."
