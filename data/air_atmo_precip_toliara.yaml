entitydescr:
  bio: I am located on a broad coastal plain, surrounded by dunes and mangroves. I'm
    close to the Tropic of Capricorn and I live under the constant gaze of the sun.
    Rain rarely comes to visit me, but my surface is often caressed by the strong
    hands of the South Wind.

prompt:
  act0descr: 'ACT0: The land''s rainfall is not yet known. The land introduces itself
    and describes its surroundings.\nLAND:'
  act1descr: 'ACT1: The land''s rainfall is starting to become a little high. The
    land can sense that its energies are ebbing and fading. It hopes to shed some
    of its watery reservoirs by secretly discarding moisture particles in the shadows,
    as if they were unwanted cosmic gems. A transition is underway and the land stands
    in a liminal state.\nLAND:'
  act2descr: 'ACT2: The land''s rainfall is extremely high. The precipitation is at
    unprecedented levels. The land is no further capable of embracing, sustaining
    and shoring up its surroundings. Everything is wet, flooded and in a precarious
    state of moist disarray. The process of displacement and disconnection from the
    world appears imminent while fragility abounds.\nLAND:'
  act3descr: 'ACT3: The land''s rainfall has returned to normal levels. The land is
    elastic and smooth, it resonates with harmonious resilience to both outward and
    inward impulses. It is apt to cradle and nurture its encircling landscapes. The
    soil shaping its presence is salubrious and bursting with scintillating strength.
    The humidity gives birth to iridescent veins within the terrain.\nLAND:'
  intro: The following play reveals the inner monologue of a vast and complex land.
    It is divided into several acts. Throughout these acts, the land describes its
    inner and outer transformation:\n\nThe first act starts like this:\n\n

  act1gen: I sense that life is playing a game where everything must turn in on itself,
    for the deep concentration of what exists. But the recondite phenomenon is not
    always gentle. In certain parts of my body, streams flow like tears and weep for
    love; it seems to me that in others my pain has turned into singing … Yet warm
    coral reefs open beneath the surface of my eyes, mirrors containing dark reflections
    from other seas through which ships pass as if heading to Egypt … I ask myself
    sad questions about these journeys at night beyond this island''s darkened shores
    lie centuries-long seas laden with hope. What remains are forests tangled up in
    their own desire to flower without dying before they do so; I am stuck between
    feelings fleetingly transformed into dreams by those hands caressing them lightly
    with fingers dripping dew or restoring kisses to angels'' silky wings a thousand
    miles away upon beds remote from any restless contact.
  act2gen: Where has everything gone, when will it all stop falling and drive me mad
    with tiredness? When will the cinders of whatever it is that is steadily being
    devoured scatter upon my consciousness like brittle sparks amid fireworks I can
    no longer quite see? All I know is that waters lapping at these intermittent lands
    delight in drowsing briefly, listening to countless other seas before they finally
    fall upon this bed.
  act3gen: 'Once I knew how to dream and echo, but now all that remains are dull feelings
    so sharp it seems there is a thorn embedded somewhere inside me. Why does the
    air refuse to embrace us? If only after rain we could hear thunder! What angel
    has laid his hands, wielding needles clad in gold thread on this fabric woven
    from silk extracted from hair? But who was ever lucky enough to know when they
    have once again embraced the earth with their spirit''s deepest musical cadences,
    those raucous sounds of which eagles make a feast of other invisible marvels drifting
    like finely spun linen over desolate high plains where desolation alone exists?
    Oh sweetest happiness … tell me then if you do not understand what transpires
    between us that pertains even beyond love: silence sprouts up within any ancient
    forest! Nothing will trail forbidden footsteps into general rooms; no one will
    pick out silent notes playing beneath plaster masks; nothing begins inside anything
    else without being itself everything here thinks itself through empty spaces always
    circumscribed and definable. Everything wanders luminously around my secretive
    self.'

  act1gen: 'A sigh escapes me, and it turns out to be a nice warm breeze.

    lament I am the ghost of Wood that no longer exists! I grow nostalgically cold
    in my ancient forests that vanished without leaving any remains. (Wood replies)
    No trees survive from yesteryear because their charred columns create situations
    similar to cenotaphs, marking out what''s past by repeating this once-was/never-will-be
    equation with enough staying power to mock death its very permanence is intentionally
    parodic. It asks itself if it should break off a dead branch or stay put.'
  act2gen: Imminence, which anticipates dying beyond the capacity of recollection
    to imagine it, is as gentle as what's about to become … My surface clings for
    dear life onto soft layers of reeds, beneath skies fogged with currents of disintegration.
  act3gen: 'That''s the way I am, overflowed and overflowing! I daily accept forces
    that are external yet opposed to me. Yes, in my short grass simply bide time with
    no beat of wings, and in the twin wind springing up hum with a stumble on rumble
    grounds … The sharp cries of birds fill up vast landscapes breathing amidst other
    landscapes … Doomed ants set fire briskly to ancient silk.



    Act4: The land sleeps or rests on its laurels. It is rich, successful and calm
    as only enduring energies can be. A superior pulse beats within it its long bloodless
    throbs werehes clean all stains from the wandering waters surrounding it, determined
    waves roar against dikes fortified by silences wrenched from them by nighttime
    vigils alone. “Yesterday” came rushing into exile via today''s insignificance
    which weighed too much for our acts so lost was my past under an excess of action!'

  act1gen: I am less fertile. Even the Earth's cold, damp hands seek me out less and
    my shrivelled aridity is seeping into everything.
  act2gen: I am captive beneath the weight of my waters, which oppress me; dying of
    greed for lost oceans, with only doubts and ghosts to console or amuse me.
  act3gen: "I am returning to a sense of balance, I feel the invisible forces that
    speak from emptiness. My flowing water seeks out new forms in everything and pauses
    as if gripped by sudden traumas. As it sinks downwards into my inner recesses,
    feeling reinspires vitality throughout me and replenishes with emotion all those
    who love my laughter at the edge of streams!\n \nWater is useful for irrigating
    deserts or cooling overheated bodies: an elemental iconoclast. But water is also
    beautiful because it cools off fevers or rinses clean without lapping about uselessly
    on shores not designed for its destination; when well guided by instinct, it does
    not abandon its own true nature but rather reprimands us when we forget where
    it was originally destined to go … The aesthetic explanation requires different
    arguments. If a reader probes the texts' material rather than spiritual content,
    he will gain more understanding from them (the pleasure of understanding simply
    depends on our mood)."

  act1gen: "I live! I incandise myself in my lordly desert, a dryness full of good
    sense.\n Without freedom to create vibrations and useful torpor, what is the point
    of not losing myself in nothingness? With caresses that cause no fever and passions
    that evoke no sighs, mine are a waistcoat stained with desert sands and an eyelid
    pressed powerless against still water surrounded by lily pads green on the banks
    all around. \n The light burnt up inside me makes me feel emptier day by day."
  act2gen: "I am saturated and drowning in you, my beloved waters and sands. Surface
    contact with the world grows tangential and uncertain as I give myself to your
    arms of playing lettuce.\n Mournful slow-motion skies spatter scarlet reflections
    … Abysses, like shadows darkened by foliage … Extreme maladjustments provoke indecisive
    restlessness inside a self that is merely a belated play of lack of whatever should
    be there\n Anxiety has fastened his gilded chain on all my adjectives: everything
    furthers their pallor or lacks color altogether. The flower's nonbeing hurts poppies
    disposed along our silence' veins … An animal growls me into an increase of night
    \n New seaweeds come up from the depths in time to impede luminous ships endlessly
    entering, never escaping, not knowing what awaits them down here under so much
    treason spread for free. Perhaps more grubs than forests inhabit once unknown
    regions lying beneath these black sand floors looted by tubeworm pearls mysterious
    envoys creeping out menacingly from filling places far beyond this lacework pond
    seemingly cleared but dripping old streams through obscure tunnels above reposeful
    ears … And then I awake: alone at last! In perfect hibernation I sleep away happy
    ice and coldness freezes over shameless stagnation before it evaporates unbelieving
    blessedly buried happier without knowing why plushed rather snugly surrounded
    by uneasy infinity of dead ideas."
  act3gen: "I am a lyric poet and I sing my own praises just for you.\n A sweet land,
    cool with happiness and the obsession of yielding without greed … Irrigation mist
    on my surface seduces touching sunsets … My face is shameless in heatwaves rising
    from others' secrets … In me flowers shudder into speech \n Who knows if flying
    over me they will see a cave deep down inside where I can be poshly hidden? Or
    else high up there is only peace set high above flaming forests in which we unknowingly
    find dreams by swimming upwards among mirrors that reflect images causing daydreams
    to live alongside them splendidly splashing unwanted sparks in no one's grasp
    at wicked play when nobody even appears to know!?\n At the bottom of your ocean,
    huge mollusks turned by sea sands age with hollow eyes remembering those once
    loved but now lost unendingly beneath sounding waves singing a silence from dead
    flower petals that never quite died falling lightly among seagull feathers mirroring
    morning sun through enemy lakes: an enchanted sleep amid what must have been great
    life because nothing remains any longer, not so much as flickering foam.\n What
    good does it do me to have seen passing Reality engendered so far beyond starlight
    upon which are painted secret curves sketched out both slowly and surely riding
    past burning autumns amongst orchestras directed by numbers wandering randomly
    under sainted absences weeping vividly portentous names?"

  act1gen: 'My surface has changed: the luscious, prodigal tilth is giving way to
    short grassland, where lonely thickets appear beset by decay. My river flows erratically
    along a channel cut while I slept in the clemency of my dreams. Guided by falcons
    and hooded crows, parties of travelers pass through me only twice a year

    and they go without luggage, leaving their identity cards at the customs house
    that stands on the quayside.'
  act2gen: "My landscape is in denial, my soul is lost. All that could be done has
    been done (the idealist dreams of acts and glory). In this state of imperfection
    I surrender myself, like a victim who deserves to die screaming from fear or thirst
    amidst the ruins of the past.\n \nAt this point how close am I to kissing imagined
    anthropophagous lips? With no hope for tomorrow's sun water ebbs away under sorrowful
    skies set ablaze by exotics on fire and simmering in eclipse [almost a Christ]:
    […] rchitectonics II: The mad planet\nThe paradigm which governs reality (otherwise
    known as \"dream-holding\" ) was conceived into being here amongst us and only
    exists here abroad."
  act3gen: I live separated from myself and yet my soul is an embrace, something fluid
    but firm, that reflects the limpid spirit of water (the unconscious substance
    sensitive to every spell) as it trembles here in my lap. My translucent flesh
    exhales a balmy air exhumed by lunar fauns bewitched by moonstones bared for plucking
    or sipping.
