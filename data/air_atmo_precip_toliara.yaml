   act0descr: 'ACT0: The land''s rainfall is not yet known. The land introduces itself and describes its surroundings.\nLAND:'
   act1descr: 'ACT1: The land''s rainfall is starting to become a little high. The land can sense that its energies are ebbing and fading. It hopes to shed some of its watery reservoirs by secretly discarding moisture particles in the shadows, as if they were unwanted cosmic gems. A transition is underway and the land stands in a liminal state.\nLAND:'
   act2descr: 'ACT2: The land''s rainfall is extremely high. The precipitation is at unprecedented levels. The land is no further capable of embracing, sustaining and shoring up its surroundings. Everything is wet, flooded and in a precarious state of moist disarray. The process of displacement and disconnection from the world appears imminent while fragility abounds.\nLAND:'
   act3descr: 'ACT3: The land''s rainfall has returned to normal levels. The land is elastic and smooth, it resonates with harmonious resilience to both outward and inward impulses. It is apt to cradle and nurture its encircling landscapes. The soil shaping its presence is salubrious and bursting with scintillating strength. The humidity gives birth to iridescent veins within the terrain.\nLAND:'
