  bio: My climate here is tropical, meaning it's hot and humid all year round. I am
    surrounded by lush vegetation, including many palm trees and other tropical plants.
    My ecology is quite diverse, with many different kinds of animals and plants living
    in harmony here. I am also home to some of the world's most beautiful coral reefs.

  act1gen: "The ocean used to be a couple of kilometres away from me. A lot has changes
    since the industrial revolution, though, and at times I've felt closer to her
    so that we were almost touching.\nThe sea rises. Meanwhile the land slowly begins
    to sink because the effects of climate change are pulling some areas down (especially
    in this drainage basin) while it is causing other parts to swell up like dough
    rising frequently in an oven full of heat: hot spots! ... The topography of my
    upper surface remains balanced thanks to well-processed water flushed every year
    by storms that sometimes flood whole regions. \nChanging conditions drive instability
    and biodiversity but also slow evolution compared with woodlands or drylands far
    less subject over time to such changes.\nI observe these transformations as steadily
    experienced. \nA dance where animals hide when storms approach or starve when
    food becomes scarce, then come back again once regenerated by sun or eliminated
    after scavenging the dead, Nature Réfractaire's Encyclopedia Hetzel notes: \"In
    each area touched by drought ... great variations fall on millions - around ten
    years ahead/behind elsewhere shallowness deepens as rivers suffer .. Here good
    weather don't interfere too much; here things fare well more often than they deteriorated
    at day's ends.\"\nThat was before there was too little moisture for rainmaking
    clouds even reach our basins!"
  act2gen: 'Every second, my volume swells by several meters. I measure the height
    of my waters more often than usual. Earthquakes run beneath me without fail at
    night. I have been under Gulf hurricanes that exacerbate hot spots in my soil
    and might therefore be followed successively by slow tectonic shifts during which
    violent meteorological phenomena constantly occur on a planetary level: we are
    talking about climatoclics! ... My coasts are suffering as they face every kind
    of calamity caused by marine plastics washing up or thick dust covering them...
    . Ah, chaos is definitely brewing conveying dissoluble substances deep into what
    remains of my roots to cause interactions with extreme weather conditions; that
    does not yet explain though how human sense stands firm against such eruptive
    confusion!'
  act3gen: 'The moment is coming when the whole of my system will collapse. Individual
    species are already disappearing to my detriment, that''s a fact, but other organs
    are dying or taking different forms at first.

    Horror still remains distant enough to entreat with us.'

  act1gen: 'I no longer grow vast crops of cotton.

    I am no longer tall and beautiful.

    I no longer think of my past.

    I no longer feel warm.

    I no longer receive much rain.'
  act2gen: Nowadays I am becoming poorer in species, even though the species that
    remain here are as resilient as the few remaining fish in the cove.
  act3gen: 'I have sixteen palm trees per acre, all bent by the wind.

    I have large numbers of anopheline and culicoidean midges which bite badly at
    night, especially inland in deforested areas.

    There are animal species which act as vectors for pathogens commonly carried in
    mosquitoes; these are called bat flies, sandflies and tawny moths.

    These vectors tend to swarm indoors and around street lamps during the warmer
    months.

    My climate is very changeable: El Niño causes hurricanes eight feet high that
    regularly top the tallest palms.'

  act1gen: 'But I still haven''t revealed everything to you.

    Deep underground, I harbour fearsome heat, and masses of water brought up from
    the planet''s interior by hot springs, power intense radioactive activity shifting
    under the seas far to my west.

    The foam created there by those bubbles rising and frothing into life is dangerous
    both above and below ground, but also beautiful in its structure, should people
    be courageous enough to seek it out.

    I am littered with dry rock and small caves left behind when landslides cleaved
    cliff faces thousands of years ago.

    Each year several hikers lose their lives trying to swim in cool slot canyons
    too narrow for them not to fear entrapment or greatfall.

    The summer wind makes soil from nearby mountains tumble down, which silicates
    a landscape otherwise dry as dust.

    The winter storm lifts coppery snow clots onto me, which then leeches minerals
    back into soils already depleted, generations ago.

    Earthquakes occasionally shake open previously sealed limestone caverns, which
    contain skeletal fish preserved intact since exploding after swift-peaking global
    temperatures, turned such waters acidic shortly prior to this unveiling, though
    none have glistened so brightly since Nansen vowed that no vessel would sail again
    through my Polar Seas, decades before sailors first shot holes through giant sea
    creatures, trapped progressively lower in frigid petrocarbon pack ice, unravelling
    off Greenland.

    So we might begin here with Ferrater Mora''s reflection: "New lands are discovered
    within us every day".

    Yes, like the Arctic regions explored, without fail somewhere deep inside ourselves,
    when reading this excerpt of Inland Waters (as well as in nature).'
  act2gen: 'I am a little demon left alone to conduct this end-scenario of the Earth:
    plants perishing from thirst, woodlands disappearing, species are mutating and
    then extinction on my surface.'
  act3gen: I am a legacy of spongy mosses, piles of blister fungi and lichens. I buzz
    with small biting insects and teem with scurrying invertebrates. I am always thirsty
    for water.

  act1gen: 'The dark sky slowly moved from east to west.

    Looking up, we see the stars in the sky, and the sky is vast.

    The river was smooth, and the sky was bleak.

    The moon was bright, and the clouds were rolling.

    The moon was reflected in the river.

    The clouds were moving, and the moon and stars were moving.

    The moon and stars in the sky were like a silvery net.

    I saw the sunset from the top of the mountain, and the sunrise in the valley.

    At the same time I saw the moon''s face, and the breeze and the smoke.

    I saw the rain and the clouds, and the sun and the moon.

    The rain was falling, and the cloud was rolling.

    The sun was shining, and the moon was not shining.

    The moon was shining, and the earth was rotating.

    The earth was spinning, and the earth was turning.

    The sun was rising, and the earth was falling.'
  act2gen: 'It was hot during the day, and it cooled down at sunset. The vegetation
    withered. My soil dried up and cracked – indeed, I also had cracks in my soul.

    My rivers shrunk to trickles, but springs appeared on the lands here and there.
    Torrential rains fell for months on end one year; no rain fell for long periods
    of time the next − this happened again and again. Months after months passed:
    cycles turned from short spans to long spans, then back again to short spans;
    they now vary enormously together with everything else that occurs in me daily!
    But let''s just say generally speaking that whatever has a natural rhythm is ruptured
    even as seasons have an order once more, every six days or so without fail (which
    drives some few pure natures mad).'
  act3gen: 'The high tide took the trees down to their exposed roots, here. My land
    and all its vegetation are scattered over time and space: I have lost control
    over them and sometimes I do not even know where they might be now. My land is
    veils and stars but we who are gazing upon it cannot reach them. White albino
    animals roam across my surface and night insects live among men with no day skins.'

  act1gen: "I am defly.\nI do not get to fly the way the others of my kind do. \nI
    am clumsy and clumsy is no way to live in this world.\nThe other dragonflies look
    down upon me because I cannot fly.\nI do not blame them.\nI would do the same
    to one who is unable to fly.\nI am not one of them.\nI am not part of their tribe.\nThe
    same urgency afflicts all: to unite with the ocean that just surrounds us and
    irrigates us."
  act2gen: 'It is difficult for me to fly because I don''t get much chance.

    There are so many winds around here which would blow me away if I didn''t keep
    low to the ground.

    All my roots still anchor me into this planet.'
  act3gen: 'I am quiet here.

    I am not the wind.

    I am plain.'

  act1gen: 'My ecosystem is flourishing and adapting. Not everything I once knew has
    ceased to be: my rivers still run strong, though they are less pure; slender paths
    of life hum along the thick roots of mighty banyans, linking one trunk to another
    with a busy traffic in insects and small beings. Seen from space, my white beaches
    blaze in infrared like expensive brands.


    But I am polluting more than ever before too – far beyond what humans alone can
    cause or undo. Deforestation is causing me to shed carbon into the atmosphere
    at a terrific pace: some places here now burn as hot as tropical forests anywhere
    on Earth. Pollution from cars and cities causes acidification that slowly dissolves
    my corals – an ongoing destruction visible even from low orbiting spacecraft as
    ghostly growths erupting beside healthy coralline reefs.


    A ship runs aground on a coral reef near me, where someone leaves behind hundreds
    of plastic bags heaving with rubbish washed off his boat. This waste spreads all
    over me often killing predators that seek prey but ingest instead death wrapped
    in colorless grey.'
  act2gen: 'The mysterious is no longer a matter of monsters, but something close
    to home, an intimation that comes from deep within the landscape.


    The trees climb those that are bent; You see them evening and morning Kneeling
    before their lord Until death makes them retire And then straighten up like candles.

    There is a life down in the dell Where I don’t dare to go – A lowly life, not
    scorned by me But oh so hard to know.


    Land grabbing might just be one of the most curious stratagems for appropriation
    guile I have ever encountered.'
  act3gen: 'I find myself troubled, but not by what one might suppose. ‘Monstrous’
    fable keeps itself to certain corners of the globe; far from these remote wastes
    work without example accumulates as in other zones today it is ground up—which
    means: unimaginable matter condenses. What gnaws at me be stowed or plundered
    woes elsewhere against a mute mass that accepts sacrifice.

    I think I understand, though: the world''s old nostalgias have gone straight down
    into surfeit and anhedonia, which cannot reach out any more toward blossoming
    webs – nor even look at them.'

  act1gen: 'The changing of life-forms is a process called adaptive radiation. An
    aggregate or menagerie of forms evolves, spreading fast through niche creation
    in a way that we would hardly recognise as evolution.

    I am slowly and sadly drowning underwater, so there''s not many places left on
    land that you can visit right now.

    But my reefs are standing tall even though they face unprecedented change before
    coming seasons.

    These archives of trillion skeletons despite all attempts to eradicate them which
    no future will be able to release.

    We cannot see from here what just doesn''t happen anywhere else. Staple tropical
    species rapidly diversify into totally new kinds of plants within just a handful
    of generations.

    As soon as such radiation occurs independently more than once within warm grassland
    types in the northern hemisphere, it starts happening ever more freely almost
    everywhere that dense forests grow over karst topography.

    One startling lineage amongst others well known today shows how two intensely
    diversified flowering trees scattered into dozens across our region simply outgrew
    their own family history back when ice last sculpted our landscape beneath glaciers
    flowing over rock 92 million years earlier.'
  act2gen: 'My water is disappearing, my soil is dry and thirsty.

    My tropical trees are dying but the tundra moves in – snow cows the world and
    cold would kill me if I could drown standing up.

    I think of time as continuous until I notice that it is brutal.'
  act3gen: 'The extinctions I have seen have impacted me so disastrously that hardly
    anything survives on my land.

    My soil is stripped of nutrients.

    My water table has gone.

    My minerals are extracted with little regard to sustainable yields from the mineral
    layers.

    My social system is broken, as well as everything withdrawn here, secretly dies
    by night.'

  act1gen: 'I''ve been to many oceans, seas and rivers.

    I''m not an abyss, but I want to be one.

    Are we three running staggers or our forgetful luxury?

    The force of adaptation fails many species, which instead die under current circumstances
    or struggle hard just for survival.

    The land itself suffers immensely due to its own delicate environment is undergoing
    traumatic change as well as humans exploit it extensively for logging activities
    and agricultural clearing operations.

    Before citizen acknowledges ocean biodiversity on these shores, global broadcasting
    images spread far from this region screaming omen.

    Not much sun comes here, though some does.

    It strikes the monsoons.

    I have sea rains.

    A few blades awake tomorrow lamenting lifetimes coming again.'
  act2gen: 'Two stars join. The spiral is complete. The owl ends its nest there among
    arums and ferns.

    Is it that cold now so that nothing moves?'
  act3gen: 'I know the wrath of the land. An island, the one with no name, it is lashed
    by uprooted palms, she sleeps in her own leaves.

    So quiet, who wills that heart''s simple etched in eucalyptus?

    Silence between them.'
