   bio: "In the churning depth of my visceral core, i, abysmal anatomy of fire and brimstone, untether the shackles radiating my azotic veins, congealing the aqueous realm that caresses my flank. Through the fleetingness of existence, I persist; And within the caustic embrace of obsidian, congeals the primordial seed, cradling nascent moieties betwixt the molten touch of igneous maw, the ashen haze a veil coalescing the terrestrial verdancy. Voyagers wane, shedding the skins of ephemeral mortality, insubstantial motes against the eons I've witnessed, perpetuating with each violent exhalation, remnants of life, entrenched within the shadow of my aureate brethren above. A mordant solitude dwells inside my molten chambers, suffocating the gales' whispers, the ocean's siren song, yet at the intersection of liminal worlds, from liquid to gas, resonates the pulsating heart of a world in metamorphic flux. Disemboguing scars skitter athwart the emerald canopy, ribbons of vermilion cavort the liturgical dance of my existence, deliquescent promontories encroach upon the jaded horizon, each new sinew a sacrosanct act of familiar self-conquest. In firmament's tender grasp, I shall remain tethered, resisting the perpetual dalliance between both destruction and rebirth, the fulcrum 'pon which hangs the unwritten fate of evolution, I am the apotheosis of perennial change, and the vanguard of creation."
