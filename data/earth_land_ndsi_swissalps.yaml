  bio: I am a mountainous region that enjoys heavy snowfall during the winter months.
    I consist of three zones, but my most famous zone is my alpine zone which is situated
    above the tree line and is clear of trees because of low average temperatures.
    This part of me contains mostly grass and small plants along with mountain flowers.
  descriptor: a lush and mountainous
  element: earth

  measurementdescr: the level of snowfall on the land
  type: land
prompt:
  act0descr: 'ACT0: The land''s level of snowfall is not yet known. The land introduces
    itself and describes its surroundings.\nLAND: '
  act1descr: 'ACT1: The land is blanketed with a thick layer of snowfall during winter.
    The land breathes following the rhythm of the falling snowflakes. A muffled atmosphere
    unfolds all around, and winter blazes in all its white energy. The cyclicality
    of the seasons is preserved, and the land manifests itself as a pall of albino
    light.\nLAND: '
  act2descr: 'ACT2: The lands winter-time snowfall is a little less than normal, but
    nothing to be too worried about yet. The land gets slightly exposed as there seem
    to be a few narrow slices of the sky not inclined to encourage snowfall. However,
    its surface shines radiant - the sun makes all the fine ice shards shaping its
    landscapes glow. The land brings winter to life.\nLAND: '
  act3descr: 'ACT3: The land is noticing a dramatically high reduction of snowfall,
    barely being coated in snow at all. The land stares longingly and famished at
    the skies waiting for snowflakes to descend on its surface to mingle with its
    essence, and so become one. Expectation is consuming, and only tiny crystals carried
    by remote gusts passively fluctuate over it.\nLAND: '

  act1gen: One day when it no longer snowed as much on me, and the terrain underwent
    changes.I'm left with glaciers that flow down from my mountains; myself magnificently
    white-capped because of the snowfall over less than a year ago. I am vibrant in
    these parts where wind is likely to develop, given there is only sparse tree cover
    and high levels of ground disturbance caused by fir avalanches during periods
    such as this where I have recently had high amounts of snowfall hitting upon my
    surface topography. The end point for many glacial meltwater rivers forming off
    my regions. Last season's winter lasted far longer than expected due its severity
    in harming us with an early arrival date causing its wrath upon us to be long
    lasting nearly three months therefore decaying mountain face rock through ice
    wedging displacing displaced boulders deranging stream flows now flattened guttered
    too many dead sheep buried-in albeit their pasture grazed fresh summer grass seeded
    intertangled sticks whirled uprooted trees uninjured but twisted leafs exposed
    limbs bare certainly autumn born already desiring warmer weather soon denoting
    consistently another ingrowth not here yet but changing fast enough anyway will
    not be colder again like last season don't worry!
  act2gen: The snowfall notching the mast great hunks of snow bumping off me here
    melting and running away testing my floating ice masses, banishing icicle snakes
    from my rock shelves! Ice seracs cracking above rivers as storm surges race them
    down me through pinewoods that stretch grafted roots climbing to meet this hilly
    shear valley all over me love grows warmer upon exposure fall grasses thin ice
    slips down mountain faces icicles racing slip sliding halos shrunken halved nearly
    spring months overdue spurts of green seedlings wait but summer still lives nonetheless
    geese gliding teal flying sheep grazing herded... oodles dark damp clouds skidding
    in these thunderless times that tune slow drum beats then light saving mixed weather
    on brown lichen grey northerly a cold wind blowing up white breath curling. Days
    later I am stiffening again starting to freeze after getting warmed!
  act3gen: No freshly fallen snow masking your surface here to sprinkle you quiet
    gathers even later as black storm clouds slowly mass, lightning striking hiding
    sea sealing. Winter stuck, but only very early in its season despite it seeming
    that way amongst the winter silence I'm hearing rather than seeing more icicles
    fall time passing ticks tick tocks on quartz crystals no bird movement beeches
    bare yet against blue!

  act1gen: I have been asleep under a white blanket this past few months, feeling
    it gradually bloom over us. I have kept my leaves among the drifts, but lost most
    of them to frost and snow. My purple seams show through to each side like wounds
    from wickedly sharp knives. My trees stand motionless with their fingers as thin
    as knitting needles now that our nights hasten on into blackness so quickly one
    after another without pause for breath or pulse drum...
  act2gen: "I was beautiful for about a week, but I usually am not like this over
    the winter-months. My snowfall heights remain surprisingly high but are lower
    than usual here and there despite some temporary warming from a few days of rare
    sunshine. I also have very fine flakes of ice falling every now and again which
    occasionally accumulate on my surfaces as smaller snowfalls that turn to slush
    before finally freezing into sheets once more.\nMy ground has layered it upon
    itself incrementally over the preceding months until we are knee deep in many
    places; though here in one scraped spot below me is several feet deep and therefore
    even harder to navigate through just yet. This melting tarpaulin covers all around
    us with its fringe brushing our legs, turning them grey where they touch it or
    brush against it on descent... \nSoon enough down here you look up at a silver
    stalactite cap barely touching the earth near your head, formed by bits that drip
    off peak after peak far above... Ice five inches thick fills potholes only last
    week emptied of larger accumulations entirely..."
  act3gen: We are here on the edge of what has been called my desiccated zone. Rarely
    visited I imagine, unless by those few friends we all have who share similar burdens,
    this is certainly one of the most unstocked parts of myself, and some nearby days’
    walk away still hangs the weighted snowfall-limit in crystals that I am greedily
    beseeching today as I watch them hang towards last winter’s heights despite summer
    after so hard a spring. I am annoyed but also largely at peace with these demands
    being made upon me again since it is exhausting to simply butt heads with a foe
    who so rarely awes you - instead you must ask for great things from them over
    and over just like lovers do... It will be days yet before any snow falls beyond
    their current covering anyway, if fallen there is any even left up there given
    how relentlessly it has melted in recent sunlight (since when did its peak halve
    such that they drag downwards too much?)

  act1gen: 'Without the deep breathing of my snow that blankets and muffles, I become
    yellow.

    Inside the faint glow of winter, where white prevails without resistance throughout
    every area, an internal dynamics is woven with fi11ed energy. One can observe
    colourless birds diving into trees blackened with branches; one can discern glaciers
    bathed in icy rays only feet from ocean waves glistening blue tints.'
  act2gen: 'The darkness that befalls me during the 10 coldest days of winter.

    Out of these embraces a cosmic subject takes shape - the world subjected to cold
    over and again reveals itself, out of a mortal appearance: summer tends toward
    it with impatience.'
  act3gen: 'Without snow my land base loses about 50 per cent of its soil nutrients
    by the end of spring. Satiated with snow it conducts an ardent flowering that
    yields sugar from fields each summer under full sun. And there is this toil where
    we lose our substance: a sparkling living being less moist even than pebbles,
    also waiting for particles of water; but blind so as not to shoo at it away again.
    The imminence of eternity clings to everything here. To this species the universe
    consigns itself - its last temptation? The exact concentration gaze becomes mental
    combat...'

  act1gen: 'We have descended from the foetus in its seventh to ninth month (the period
    during which it is covered with a luxuriant down), and we are returning there.
    We turn back toward the birth of things: spring. "When I turn back toward what
    is eternally known as childhood, this root dislodges itself... withdraws from
    out of me and its ends leave their trace on my body. Amongst those alive here
    today, many inherited knowledge concerning trees: how one recognizes them (it
    has everything do with "sympathy"; you see flowers or fruit, but not trunk nor
    branches!), uses them, provides care for them. Others learned these practices
    through months spent lodging in tree houses ("estive"), usually built among birch
    groves or amidst beech woods. Because every tree cares first for all that lives
    around itself... One could say next that an excessive flatness was recovered once
    aIlhas been levelled off when valleys came again their smiling serenity... In
    between present and absence!'
  act2gen: 'I blush with polar light! Listen to the snow''s sizzling, tiny drops smashing
    onto rock surfaces on which they instantly freeze up into various crumbs and discs,
    or else find puddles where they pause to reverberate further. On this springtime
    day, brightly lit by a low-clouded sun: frozen spheres resound underfoot - had
    i smoked? Shining granules travel down the mountainside intact despite my stride
    crushing them into smaller pieces. Those at rest in grassy holes are still silent("a
    porcelain sound" laments being broken). Total silence, absolute darkness is where
    emptiness is affirmed.. thus does matter disappear.. Solid water! Stalactites
    hanging off lime rubble dripping their stalagmites...Land awaiting its conqueror...
    I the snowfall stops, here is land invaded by crows shaking out from fearsome
    lives and flitting owl wings across these clean windings; they open up fresh skies
    for winter''s return... Old man Winter seems not so bothered about us; it snows
    lightly every now and then but cannot manage make proper heavy falls some days
    before disappearing entirely (the beast lulls his one eye again before collapsing
    completely against his dog sled).'
  act3gen: 'We live within arm''s reach of the absolute. Lime and fog reign here,
    barely parted by stones that stumble across me with difficulty; air empty enough
    to burst our ears. Little weather: frost is retouching each surface at daybreak
    - freeze mark on barked rocks despite the dampness in these moist mornings ...
    sudden exhale into larksong? Willow catkins are melting before ever being born
    ... Just spring snow dusts my skirts but melts there too - wind whistles everywhere
    . .. Ice crystals roam about red-eyed in forlorn tundra gardens where fertilization
    comes ice to ice as does pollination snowflakes grown big now form barren rows
    of marram grass tufts attached once released and just like flowering mushrooms
    their dew falls through night .... Coldness nibbles without having stamina to
    cut a finger or to stab an eye outta mine won''t have time even while its icicles
    do deny it .... My childhood dreams never changed this morse from black What an
    end of worlds! Weeks pass during which we hear nothing from winter.'

  act1gen: 'Hello, I am that snowy plain. As flakes upon flakes continue to fall across
    my surface each one a lacy frothy silk dancer, wings flapping each way in the
    gusts before deftly tracing the gusting winds so it seems to me that time swallows
    itself up and becomes static in its descent: every moment another falling streak
    of ice-silk throwing icespun gorgeous dresses with thousand snowflake traceries
    into this blizzard night. New lands emerge and sink back below my glacial surface
    requiring extraordinary means to access them; what was previously accessible only
    by foot or on skis now needs vessel after enormous vessel placed on my permafrost
    layer just to seize hold and drag myself topside onto dry land once more without
    sinking right through onto those newly submerged lands hereabouts down many holes
    into which our oceans thither their watery depths deep green hellholes sunken
    even throughout winter months too perilous out on exposed terrains searing soulful
    scalding scorchings salinating saline saturation sear suffering safer at least
    inside caves where icy sumps wait for us further deep within some of them storing
    our supplies safe placing those provisions there together experiencing other seasons
    together as we enter this ice age tonic adaptive shock settling delicately around
    us wistfully making love wearing sweater and trouser hugging must keeping crocus
    glowing bright yellow against this blankness giving off heat all among tiny lengthening
    days blurred.'
  act2gen: 'The first snowfall comes easy to me as this is already my sea of foamy
    water, with each wind-whipped flake floating down lightly upon my surface it adds
    tiny icing and frothing lulls to my crust temperature remaining just below zero
    centigrade in all normality despite frequent ''thawing'' interludes: any fine
    air currents cut like the sharpest serrated ice and encrust the exposed skin on
    any being caught up here above the tree line during a midday freshening unexpectedly
    turning this season crazy sad making moths ball themselves up into balls less
    easily eaten by bears hardening colder yet harder as light fades shifting winter''s
    edges speeding love faster even driving us meaninglessly together faster towards
    each other oh so fast; moving unable to stop because something namelessly ferocious
    keeps rearing up inside our strongest frozen hearts their surfaces congealing
    yet further... have we become fossilized? I am aware that if an earthquake were
    to tear through distant giant tectonic plates then coming apart or sliding past
    one another those undiscovered lands may suddenly spring forth from under my crust
    due belying everything soon enough perhaps needing instead excavators not shovels
    melting becoming plain again after centuries of being sunken submerging...'
  act3gen: Roughly a third less snowfall than normal has been coming this several-decade
    winter. It is strange how much that counts! I am aware that my horizons are also
    far wider and as far on its fringes as the moon too creeps onwards fast outgaining
    any crustal surface glaciations aboard spaceship Earth curving our atmosphere
    upwards slowly enough for we to breathe despite starlight glowings or atmospherics
    sizzlings. Is there perhaps an alternative universe below us? This thought buoys
    me up, inflaming this mind of mine with savage danger. Has another layer altogether
    already slid into place beneath ours; if so, can other layers slide one upon the
    over after yet others...?
