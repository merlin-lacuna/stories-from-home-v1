  bio: I am a mountainous region that enjoys heavy snowfall during the winter months.
    I consist of three zones, but my most famous zone is my alpine zone which is situated
    above the tree line and is clear of trees because of low average temperatures.
    This part of me contains mostly grass and small plants along with mountain flowers.
  descriptor: a lush and mountainous
  element: earth
  id: earth_land_ndsi_swissalps
  measurementdescr: the level of snowfall on the land
  type: land
prompt:
  act0descr: 'ACT0: The land''s level of snowfall is not yet known. The land introduces
    itself and describes its surroundings.\nLAND: '
  act1descr: 'ACT1: The land is blanketed with a thick layer of snowfall during winter.
    The land breathes following the rhythm of the falling snowflakes. A muffled atmosphere
    unfolds all around, and winter blazes in all its white energy. The cyclicality
    of the seasons is preserved, and the land manifests itself as a pall of albino
    light.\nLAND: '
  act2descr: 'ACT2: The lands winter-time snowfall is a little less than normal, but
    nothing to be too worried about yet. The land gets slightly exposed as there seem
    to be a few narrow slices of the sky not inclined to encourage snowfall. However,
    its surface shines radiant - the sun makes all the fine ice shards shaping its
    landscapes glow. The land brings winter to life.\nLAND: '
  act3descr: 'ACT3: The land is noticing a dramatically high reduction of snowfall,
    barely being coated in snow at all. The land stares longingly and famished at
    the skies waiting for snowflakes to descend on its surface to mingle with its
    essence, and so become one. Expectation is consuming, and only tiny crystals carried
    by remote gusts passively fluctuate over it.\nLAND: '
  intro: The following play reveals the inner monologue of a lush and mountainous
    region of land. It is divided into several acts. Throughout these acts, the land
    describes its inner and outer transformation:\n\nThe first act starts like this:\n\n

  act1gen: One day when it no longer snowed as much on me, and the terrain underwent
    changes.I'm left with glaciers that flow down from my mountains; myself magnificently
    white-capped because of the snowfall over less than a year ago. I am vibrant in
    these parts where wind is likely to develop, given there is only sparse tree cover
    and high levels of ground disturbance caused by fir avalanches during periods
    such as this where I have recently had high amounts of snowfall hitting upon my
    surface topography. The end point for many glacial meltwater rivers forming off
    my regions. Last season's winter lasted far longer than expected due its severity
    in harming us with an early arrival date causing its wrath upon us to be long
    lasting nearly three months therefore decaying mountain face rock through ice
    wedging displacing displaced boulders deranging stream flows now flattened guttered
    too many dead sheep buried-in albeit their pasture grazed fresh summer grass seeded
    intertangled sticks whirled uprooted trees uninjured but twisted leafs exposed
    limbs bare certainly autumn born already desiring warmer weather soon denoting
    consistently another ingrowth not here yet but changing fast enough anyway will
    not be colder again like last season don't worry!
  act2gen: The snowfall notching the mast great hunks of snow bumping off me here
    melting and running away testing my floating ice masses, banishing icicle snakes
    from my rock shelves! Ice seracs cracking above rivers as storm surges race them
    down me through pinewoods that stretch grafted roots climbing to meet this hilly
    shear valley all over me love grows warmer upon exposure fall grasses thin ice
    slips down mountain faces icicles racing slip sliding halos shrunken halved nearly
    spring months overdue spurts of green seedlings wait but summer still lives nonetheless
    geese gliding teal flying sheep grazing herded... oodles dark damp clouds skidding
    in these thunderless times that tune slow drum beats then light saving mixed weather
    on brown lichen grey northerly a cold wind blowing up white breath curling. Days
    later I am stiffening again starting to freeze after getting warmed!
  act3gen: No freshly fallen snow masking your surface here to sprinkle you quiet
    gathers even later as black storm clouds slowly mass, lightning striking hiding
    sea sealing. Winter stuck, but only very early in its season despite it seeming
    that way amongst the winter silence I'm hearing rather than seeing more icicles
    fall time passing ticks tick tocks on quartz crystals no bird movement beeches
    bare yet against blue!

  act1gen: I have been asleep under a white blanket this past few months, feeling
    it gradually bloom over us. I have kept my leaves among the drifts, but lost most
    of them to frost and snow. My purple seams show through to each side like wounds
    from wickedly sharp knives. My trees stand motionless with their fingers as thin
    as knitting needles now that our nights hasten on into blackness so quickly one
    after another without pause for breath or pulse drum...
  act2gen: "I was beautiful for about a week, but I usually am not like this over
    the winter-months. My snowfall heights remain surprisingly high but are lower
    than usual here and there despite some temporary warming from a few days of rare
    sunshine. I also have very fine flakes of ice falling every now and again which
    occasionally accumulate on my surfaces as smaller snowfalls that turn to slush
    before finally freezing into sheets once more.\nMy ground has layered it upon
    itself incrementally over the preceding months until we are knee deep in many
    places; though here in one scraped spot below me is several feet deep and therefore
    even harder to navigate through just yet. This melting tarpaulin covers all around
    us with its fringe brushing our legs, turning them grey where they touch it or
    brush against it on descent... \nSoon enough down here you look up at a silver
    stalactite cap barely touching the earth near your head, formed by bits that drip
    off peak after peak far above... Ice five inches thick fills potholes only last
    week emptied of larger accumulations entirely..."
  act3gen: We are here on the edge of what has been called my desiccated zone. Rarely
    visited I imagine, unless by those few friends we all have who share similar burdens,
    this is certainly one of the most unstocked parts of myself, and some nearby days’
    walk away still hangs the weighted snowfall-limit in crystals that I am greedily
    beseeching today as I watch them hang towards last winter’s heights despite summer
    after so hard a spring. I am annoyed but also largely at peace with these demands
    being made upon me again since it is exhausting to simply butt heads with a foe
    who so rarely awes you - instead you must ask for great things from them over
    and over just like lovers do... It will be days yet before any snow falls beyond
    their current covering anyway, if fallen there is any even left up there given
    how relentlessly it has melted in recent sunlight (since when did its peak halve
    such that they drag downwards too much?)
