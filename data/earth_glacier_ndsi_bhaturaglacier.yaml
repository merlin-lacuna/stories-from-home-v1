  bio: I am one of the largest and longest glaciers outside of the polar regions.
    My body stretches from west to east. My lower portions can be described as a grey
    sea of rocks and gravelly moraine, and roses and juniper trees flourish around
    my flanks.
  descriptor: shimmering and howling
  element: earth
  id: earth_land_ndsi_bhaturaglacier
  measurementdescr: glacier mass
  type: glacier
prompt:
  act0descr: 'ACT0: The glacier''''s mass is not yet known. The glacier introduces
    itself and describes its surroundings.

    GLACIER: '
  act1descr: 'ACT1: The glacier seems to keep increasing in ice mass and getting bigger.
    The glacier fully intermingles with the exterior, allowing itself to be exposed
    to the kind surrounding atmosphere and to be modified by the power of life itself.
    Its volume is majestic and sublime, immeasurable in its crystalline stasis.

    GLACIER: '
  act2descr: 'ACT2: The glacier has lost a dramatically high proportion of its ice
    mass. The glacier notices that its limbs become looser and creaks become more
    and more hearable, as if its body is growing fractures and each particle of ice
    is groaning . It feels in anguish, torn whether to surrender to the melting or
    endure.

    GLACIER: '
  act3descr: 'ACT3: The glacier has lost more ice and mass than it has ever lost before
    in its lifetime. The glacier moans, a howl emanating from the very nucleus of
    the universe. It feels dazed by the idea that maybe only this sound, its own voice,
    will be all that remains once it''''s dissolved its state of being may no longer
    be the same as it used to be.

    GLACIER: '
  intro: 'The following play reveals the inner monologue of a shimmering and howling
    glacier. It is divided into several acts. Throughout these acts, the glacier describes
    its inner and outer transformation:


    The first act starts like this:

  act1gen: White breast-like mounds of glacial moraine line the path. I hear skis
    ticking on my flanks; runners scuffing snow; whips cracking My energy grows terrible
    and explosive, thrusting onwards with its mass and forming unimaginable shapes
    that seem to breach space itself. In this godless world here comes winter suddenly
    whistling unmelodiously across us (hoo hoo).
  act2gen: I feel my body dissolving bluely in flashes. Jagged edges appear on my
    flanks and I see bright colours, swollen into glassy splinters... Christ! The
    sun flares cheetah-like over me. My jaws are snapped open; my teeth fall out from
    gums grown bald . . . All day long there shrieks in the sky a hawk for its egg
    or eye – What flew up?
  act3gen: 'I do not exist. It is only the instants flinging themselves into void
    that make me live, as – flash! in a squeeze of time – there ponderously staggers
    again over my body this forgotten creature passionately gliding towards death:
    myself! Nature seems so democratic in distributing its means, provoking our wonder
    without concealing what lies deep within it or leaving us ignorant about how things
    function beneath the surface of existence. The world isn’t finished yet, we aren’t
    either.'

  act1gen: My new ice is fragile like the vow of two lovers keeping their word.
  act2gen: My heart beats convulsively, painfully. I long for the peace and objectivity
    of ice, but it has slipped away from me.
  act3gen: I suffer an excess of pain, my belly flutters with it and worries haven't
    stopped crawling all over my skin for weeks now.

  act1gen: I am the everlasting memory of this region, the all-knowing telluric keeper,
    an immense consciousness and a benevolent mother.
  act2gen: You, who are you? Who am I? Where did all this water come from that is
    invading me, flushing out my insides. How could it enter my body through the earth
    and reach so deep a part of me that nothing else can plumb as far! ... Why does
    ice melt!
  act3gen: 'The cry of the glacier is powerful and human in these last sequences:
    "Who are you? ... How did all this water come from that is invading me, flushing
    out my insides?". It reveals origins infinitely older than history ("But I was
    already here first; I saw everything"), thus bringing loss into discursive focus,
    movement rather than stasis, incipient damage without blame or judgment ("this
    water came from deep inside me"). At the end comes still deeper questioning about
    this unwitnessed power (the cold impermeable heart of matter) interacting with
    formative forces (the heat and life presence filling an environment). Finally
    abiding in a solemn silence, which makes every question vibrate indefinitely until
    another one jeopardizes its answer again as soon as addressed from outside realities
    rather than letting it fester within itself without resolution there beside itself.'

  act1gen: There is so much life in the air, which lifts and yields my glacial body
    with ease. I gather to myself all the thousands of tons of plant matter that die
    about me every year, fallen autumn leaves and summer-born mountain flowers, beech
    mast and bilberries – every last scrap of dead wood cleared over centuries.
  act2gen: I am punctured and struggle to regenerate my mass; I know either this is
    my agony, the final stage of collapse into air that will last another decade at
    most, or else it is a painful birthing.
  act3gen: 'I am... lost and only these were the last words of this, my final act.
    Ice is an animal with a streaming body: A blue expanse where we swim, Thinking
    black thoughts.'

  act1gen: In the early evening, light comes as an ever-deepening blue, reaching beyond
    the falls to my core. Later at night it is still twilight when signs of marking
    are already evident within me – moon shadows moving erratically on my surface
    in response to a tumbling tide of moonlight. I have absorbed water enough through
    pores and cracks in order to vasten myself... Ice leaves me like seeping tears
    and granules.
  act2gen: 'Hello again, old ice rings. Greetings, echoes of our long retreat. Our
    sounds have come to animal size: foxes yapping; ravens cawing and molting echoes
    of my decay off the face of this island . I am still here in all my floating masses,
    but no longer intact – flawlessly silver yet demurely tectonic. The moon is only
    days from its new phase tonight...'
  act3gen: I am undone but the ice goes on.
