   bio: "I, the fiery leviathan, breathe a cloak of fear, in the whispers of wind and the tremors of ground, my presence finds solace in shadows, pervades the dawn of existence. With a voice denuded in turmoil, I tempt  The clouds above, voraciously swarming An ebony embrace, these abstruse spirits, mingling in the grip of an amorous ambiance. Tendrils of verdancy my rebellion, their grasp slinking upon my rugged spine, attempting a fleetingly consummated union, gigantic confinements languidly intertwined. The cascading brooks, they murmur secrets, the offspring of my tempestuous despair, yet I heed their gentle penance, a solace, my womb births life, even as I reign with fire. Florid mosaic arise from thy ashen remains, petrified memories of nature's dalliance, evanescent shades of agony and ecstasy, enduring testament of my transgression. Amidst interwoven veins of flickering sun, moistened soil, the kin of feather and fur, their fugitive worlds encircle, bear witness to an ancient dance, a divine absurdity, intrinsic to the symphony that orchestrates my essence. Neither a tyrant, nor guardian, dare I feign, merely the genesis to both inferno and sanctuary, the cradle of life and the purveyor of liberating agony, as they dwell in the penumbra of my dominion."
