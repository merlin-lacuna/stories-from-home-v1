  bio: "Among mine peaks, stern guardians unnamed, thy lofty fortresses beside the heavens, swathed in a lustrous robe of variegated hues, each morning's light heralds my metamorphosis. Some elements within me remain untamed, posing a threat to curious wanderers; Yet also, I offer moments of reprieve, as blossoms awaken to whisper their enchantment. In newfound times, my countenance is obscured By curtain of ever-persistent rain, a symphony of water droplets, caressing my slopes, my verdant world awakens. These days serve witness to the divine in nature— My feathered children frolic, unbidden, a gentle breeze whispers the tales of centuries, and from beneath brown earth spring forth lush greens. Upon my ridges, dear horned creatures reside, nestled amid my blanketed meadows, they roam freely on this precipice, so close to the skies whence angels reside. As shifting turns adorns my lofty station, the wintry touch descends with quiet majesty; Ye white apparitions of ephemeral beauty, gently laying claim to their temporary dominion. Thus, from many faces am I formed; A shapeshifter barring both certainty and absolution. Yet beneath this veil of shifting climes, dear traveler, take refuge and solace in my changeable embrace."

Everything streams seamlessly, engendering a cycle of universal euphony.\nLAND:'
   act2descr: 'ACT2: The c02 in the air above the land is at tolerable levels. Although there is more carbon dioxide in the air, the ecosystem of the land is still coping well. Equilibrium is offering a bright pace to the land. This represents the highest aim to which all the eras yearn. Balance''s oscillation is a brittle and alluring condition. The CO2 acts in synergy with the organisms that enliven the land; each creature is attuned to its own inner states. The whole energy on the globe is geared and activated to react to the anomalies with a generating spirit.\nLAND:'
   act3descr: 'ACT3: The c02 in the air above the land is at worrying levels. There is too much carbon dioxide in the air and the ecosystem of the land is beginning to suffer. The breezy rhythm at which the clouds used to dance appears to be muted. A colorless omen looms, like a shadow from which absolutely nothing can evade. The land is getting darker under this threat. The C02 is keeping the environment under siege, poised to make its graceful vigor perish.\nLAND:'
