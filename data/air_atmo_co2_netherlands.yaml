  bio: "In me, the rivers split their course, water flowing above and below— A city''s veins, stretching across My strong and pulsing heart. From the North Sea fell a mist, gently curving over my being, bathed in hues of grey and silver, and so my countenance is veiled. Spring unfurls its many charms As tulips blossom in secret places, verdant whispers arouse the emerald fields, and life makes home in every crevice. My gardens and ecologies harmonize, the voices of flora, a symphony divine, elements interweave, speaking softly In the eternal cycle, sonnets of the earth. And in the midst of autumn''s bounty, the russet leaves, they fall and wane, yet ever dancing and twirling, in the ever-coursing wind. Cold winter embraces me, like a friend, calming the swirls of water and vibrancy, ice-draped landscapes gleam, a thousand diamonds atop my soul. So I linger, the stage on which seasons play, ever-changing and constant each proceeding day, for within the spectrum of the vibrant and pale, a depthful beauty prevails. Time steals unrelenting and unaware, yet, I stand ageless and watchful, in the union of sun and sea''s whispers, i dwell, I am."

   intro: 'The following play reveals the inner monologue of a temperate region of land close to several large bodies of water. It is divided into several acts. Throughout these acts, the land describes its inner and outer transformation:\n\nThe first act starts like this:\n\n'
   act0descr: 'ACT0: The c02 in the air above the land is not yet known. The land introduces itself and describes its surroundings.\nLAND:'
   act1descr: 'ACT1: The c02 in the air above the land is at unprecedented levels. There is far too much carbon dioxide in the air and the ecosystem of the land is suffering significantly with the effects of the greenhouse gasses taking hold. A process of asphyxiation is now advancing, sparing no single breathing entity. The purity of the earth is tainted; the CO2 performs like the greaser of a plague coming from the Infinite. No longer can anything filter out the blazing sun''s force, which is ceaselessly consuming lives.\nLAND:'
   act2descr: 'ACT2: The c02 in the air above the land is at worrying levels. There is too much carbon dioxide in the air and the ecosystem of the land is beginning to suffer. The breezy rhythm at which the clouds used to dance appears to be muted. A colorless omen looms, like a shadow from which absolutely nothing can evade. The land is getting darker under this threat. The C02 is keeping the environment under siege, poised to make its graceful vigor perish.\nLAND:'
   act3descr: 'ACT3: The c02 in the air above the land is at very healthy levels. The healthy balance of carbon dioxide and oxygen is allowing the ecosystem of the land to function as it should.  The CO2 fluctuates as keeper and protector of the Earth''s well-being; its regulations make the land and the skies embracing its mass breathe in unison, letting even the most impervious places pulsate with pleasure and delight. Everything streams seamlessly, engendering a cycle of universal euphony.\nLAND:'
