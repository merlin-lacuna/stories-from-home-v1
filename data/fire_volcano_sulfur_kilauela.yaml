   bio: "A paradox of flame, a testimony of absurdity, in me, congealed marvels converge, emergent from depths, unseen for millenniums, here, where carnal landscapes merge. Sublime chaos, my essence unleashed, fiend of infernal molten attire; My burning spontaneity sears the ashen sky, affliction and abundance, virescent desire. On the fringes of my warm embrace, sweet nectar thrives, effulgent presence; A lush haven borne of fierce intensity, in fire''s breath, each life finds its essence. Of desolation and fertility anon, this island, a bastion of the absurd; My lava tongues bespeak mortality''s infirmity, a stark symbiosis converging and blurred. Ephemeral, the wax and wane of clouds, like words, like thoughts that depart; A symphony of wind and rain resounds, pervading my battered, primal heart. An iodine kiss, that saline tide, whispering to the churning shore; I offer my tears, scorching siren swells, explosions of lust, they implore. Then, in the dark cloak of night, when sun''s realm retreats and settles; Cradled by the vast cosmic quilt, moon''s silver caress, in me, nestles. Entwined with the laughter of stars, I bleed and rejoice, deep passion imbued; Mine, an existence of visceral delight, sublimely obscene, eternally renewed."
