  bio: I am a mountainous region that was the site of a former mine. I was originally
    just a small ski area, but I have since expanded to become one of the largest
    ski resorts in the region. My climate is characterized by cold, snowy winters
    and cool, humid summers. I am surrounded by forests, mountains, and rivers.
  descriptor: a lush and mountainous
  element: earth
  id: earth_land_ndsi_poland
  measurementdescr: the level of snowfall on the land
  type: land
prompt:
  act0descr: 'ACT0: The land''s level of snowfall is not yet known. The land introduces
    itself and describes its surroundings.\nLAND: '
  act1descr: 'ACT1: The land is blanketed with a thick layer of snowfall during winter.
    The land breathes following the rhythm of the falling snowflakes. A muffled atmosphere
    unfolds all around, and winter blazes in all its white energy. The cyclicality
    of the seasons is preserved, and the land manifests itself as a pall of albino
    light.\nLAND: '
  act2descr: 'ACT2: The lands winter-time snowfall is a little less than normal, but
    nothing to be too worried about yet. The land gets slightly exposed as there seem
    to be a few narrow slices of the sky not inclined to encourage snowfall. However,
    its surface shines radiant - the sun makes all the fine ice shards shaping its
    landscapes glow. The land brings winter to life.\nLAND: '
  act3descr: 'ACT3: The land has never seen such a lack of snow in winter before in
    its lifetime. It is dry and naked. The land no longer has any snow strata gracing
    and encircling it body. The whiteness that once emanated luminescence is now merely
    a nostalgic reminiscence of a bygone era that seems to have never occurred. Winter
    is not anymore a season, but rather a dream of melted crystal.\nLAND: '
  intro: The following play reveals the inner monologue of a lush and mountainous
    region of land. It is divided into several acts. Throughout these acts, the land
    describes its inner and outer transformation:\n\nThe first act starts like this:\n\n

  act1gen: 'With each flap of snowflakes on the window, my heart gathers like a so-le
    minchion.~~ The growing winter darkness triggers in me a circumscription of purposiveness
    and power: I am not yet known well, but it is appropriate that I cover myself
    with eight to twelve feet during midwinter. I reveal for myself, as movements
    through time, of one the concrete region''s relationship to its substrate quite
    another from those described in ''the land''. This place has always been very
    wet and marshy; an enormous amount of peat was generated here over thousands as
    years ago by decaying tree stumps and mosses, especially after the forest began
    to clear around 5000 agos.'
  act2gen: 'I cry and do not hear my cries. The sun is no longer a face thrown into
    the skies by clouds, nor does it turn itselt into moons later on: -It is completely
    and concretely circulated through up there.Ice cracking, willow bending... and
    stars unblocking from their rooms of night. During the winter solstice, I celebrate
    one with snowfalls born in Antarctica one million air miles distant that render
    pollen white. My expanses, each more than two square miles wide, are traversed
    by rivers joined at their bottoms since sliver numinous blue electricity along
    me as trout swim to shore for mating sex jump spawning find Lenten warmth black
    brown quickness wildness grow. Kelp here is alive with things deeper growing.
    It all contains certain testimony the essence of which no would be wrong simply
    to decode; such poems challenge our ways of approaching reality (including deep
    rooted prejudices) just as much as they explore it.'
  act3gen: Here are no more cries, except those trembling sown by breaths. The meadow,
    erect and gloomy before us, echoes with the last drive of birds to their temporary
    stalls. A young buck pauses in a clearing until twilight delivers him such shadows
    that he becomes invisible again.

  act1gen: 'Quick! take shelter before that dry snow pile collapses! I am stable now,
    months after the last flakes fell.

    The ashes of trees can be found at my core: exfoliating right through winter,
    craving a burst of sap mere centuries from sprouting. Here the land is part body;
    both plastic and clotting-the skeleton in embryo, shot through with frozen sap
    and descending from an ignored past into potential futures. The whispers form
    but not enough to disrupt the white silence around us: Where were you? asks one
    tree inside this silent cocoon. I was being born down yonder where everything
    grew cold~ here another tree speaks: we were stalking stars among scales that
    drifted away. I hadn''t come!, says another manmade thing made silent under all
    these layers. This densest layer hums like lowland background noise so we move
    further into its thickening toward fringe quiet -a blizzard beyond time moves
    fine snow across these grasses... singing whispering ghosts, singing whispering
    gales...'
  act2gen: 'I haven''t slept this late all winter... the birches here, bright glare
    on their trunks tinged with olive green and they lean out of shade into yellow
    sunlight... mostly flattened leaf litter shining black leaves on the ground -
    thousands, tens of thousands; silver varnish shiny as ice there are two hawthorns
    closing tight a crack in a gatepost ... soils sedimentary: squeezed by tablecloths
    pine needles thick buried like an undermattress milk blue shaken over fallen hardwood,
    densely leavened humus tilings space so snow must gather now big flakes rest heavy
    sinking into clippings. Time has shattered some of those scales though none actually
    shatter ~ three mallard wing-antlers propped at neck height against boulders turning
    brown streamclouds driving clouds behind rain falling bluish through skies cloudy
    cold cloud hangover hungover from brains blown away stoned blowing left... lost
    going nowhere fast... time not keeping up ... reflecting with little plants, metallic
    sounding ears to amplified sounds surfacing waving fruiting trees forming hypothermic
    unions till matters sunk... silt glistens... rose redfleshed... ready humid ...
    and oaks groan together... orangegrey light breaking lowland bone... dryness,
    colder drifting northward... finer but hardened weather... fine dried water sinks
    skin deep, darkening cities souls clotted lungs constricted nose upturned urging
    smog upward.'
  act3gen: 'We are mountains surrounded by oceans except for one small shore where
    we form headland into river.

    I have always been snowless before last night. The days darken around what little
    sun there is.

    The light steady but with heat comes off the boulders incasing me here and the
    cloud bastions hang low in grey shrouded sky overhead all close overheads blotted
    shades shroud sore, dry mouthed sippers crowd thickset trampling beyond desolation
    through a blur without boundaries and I stand waiting thumbs deeply thrust hooks
    sunk haglike mouths held open widely rock proud to show teeth who shall ride parched
    sterile tongues? Entombment of flesh empowers sight within bedrock, handbreadth
    eyes pressed deep every heartbeat drums meschianza muttered murmurous melody pushed
    out upon ground air flattened beneath feet driven downwards chill so deep it slows
    time to loss!'

  act1gen: 'Snow overwhelms the me: it covers my forests and gardens, binds my rivers
    into frigid strings. The sky above me burns with a starless pallor. Wrinkling
    his brows over winter''s white wastes, birds that would not sing nor fly are whetted
    in warm feathers that they will moult on spring''s arrival. The big thaw will
    begin at last to melt the snowy tombs and inflame life once more. With my rising
    temperature, I will soon crackles along with dry grasses and fragile rodents who
    emerge from underneath their blankets of ice.'
  act2gen: 'I struggled during those winters, when my snowpack failed to stay perpetually
    enticing: a weak layer formed with that inadequately cool precipitation.'
  act3gen: 'Could it thus be time, in this night without sunshine, for me to awaken?


    The winter solstice approaches. The palpable anticipation of the people of the
    land portrays a deep sense of anxiety. I do not an ticipate its arrival: that
    solar salute will only scorch my surface. Now I wait! My body freezes during sleepless
    nights; what is more - perhaps worst - so does my soul... while the snowpack is
    involved with recreating itself ready for its yearly undoing, a partially mutilated
    atmosphere gathers around the region already (in combination with another presence).
    Sunlight burns horizontally through two cloud layers whose bottoms are drawn together
    in string-like shapes just above ground level (this phenomena appearing from mid
    December onwards), effectively shading considerable extents of landscape from
    direct incident sunlight which often becomes absent altogether from late January
    on wards. I describe myself as being traumatized by these events and I feel forgotten.
    Stone still holds me upright into this altar space where I have sacrificed entire
    fields and forests rlght here before humankind rose.'

  act1gen: Old white grey winds blow through fresh snowfall. Frozen pieces raining,
    tumbling, snowing, whirling Tracelessness I am... that which numbs you with its
    whiteness and strikes you by knocking off your skis! My enormous snowflakes envelop
    the land and don't allow anything else through.
  act2gen: I know that early snow will help my vegetation survive the warm weather
    of summer. My pines, spruces and firs cradle a dark soil into which my scorched
    earth has retreated; shivering trees await shafts of sunlight through my rustling
    leaves to see them through the hot months.
  act3gen: I cannot remember all my winter stories, Sometimes I partially awaken and
    get nervous; This wasn't always like this. Still bereft of any significant quantity
    of snow cover beyond early springtime... preparation for the summer to come. I
    am hot however, thanks to long hours of strong sunshine during the short days
    of my chilly lengthening nights. Each glacier struggles with its own internal
    melt-rate - many are close to becoming seasonal rivers once again in flow rate.
    ‘Snow’ as a word occurs rarely here now – discarded in favour of ravaging words

  act1gen: 'The snow falls in large drifts and is piled up against the tree trunks
    in whirlwinds. It fills my gulleys and valleys with fury. As it engulfs me: pressure,
    panting, frozen gleaming black outcrops; mood of crisis – the lurking muscles
    of peril that hobble the escaping springs by their distrust. Ahead I see my own
    trees shivering dumbly under jellied blankness – lumps at last unmasked whose
    shameless massiness they take to be hidden instead as numb spasms...'
  act2gen: 'Apocalypse is your name for what you fear. Apocalypse as cold toil and
    hot affronts everywhere... What can I do, some uprightness that has lost its heady
    darknesses? Purity hasn''t entered me except through the water: ice-bucket on
    brain handle.'
  act3gen: 'Ӏt is in heaven''s hush I feel the echoing winters. No wonder you keep
    carrying a lump of ice around with you, like a lucky charm or some fetish against
    dryness: if we get hypothermically wet and hard ...


    The seasons turn over every few years; individual snowfalls come down on various
    dates within their cycles across millennia. There are long gaps of uninhabited
    time between each weather systems arrival – indeterminate plateaus punctuated
    by surrealist flashes where no life takes place at all except those tiny mutations
    glimpsed only under slow proton scopes and ultraviolet eyes.'

  act1gen: I'm covered in snow and I try to imagine You, but either my head is too
    cold or you're extinguished. Ah, the red hot winter has only removed your sound
    to lean on the land at last, whose melody is no more...
  act2gen: A dainty ice gown, it seems, is cutting me off from the sky in which I
    was one of its stars. Through my raised naked shoulders, see a landscape that
    has moved thousands of kilometers around me...
  act3gen: The whistling wind falls on my naked back where I'm bleeding... while swatting
    furiously in order to get snowflakes back.

  act1gen: 'Its total silence, like that of the dead. I''m deafened by mausoleums
    white stones. A winter which is both tranquil and watchful points toward a boundary
    with another act, where the darkness brandishes its strength once again.  How
    night''s dark wind cleanses! Crows flap their wings at dawn... rusted eyes...
    crushed bramble.. Something has departed from among these words which could have
    uttered: night raids; ferocity; shadow-dogs; barking at moonrise in every field
    without being comprehended further along or enriched deeper down - because they
    resolve into simple winters capable of inflicting harm, biting tongues pink and
    soft as female flesh exposed through half-open mouths branded with immediate screams.
    The unquietness praised throughout those days brims with potential threats treated
    scrupulously by the poet who apprehends them for him alone (under pain of ever
    having been there).'
  act2gen: The icy breath of silence... such warmth in the cold that gathers near
    the trees. My vision witnesses a blustery sea. The frosty land is slowly reborn
    without enemies. Nothing to fear (except perhaps for.. )
  act3gen: 'It''s been several months since I have felt snow, that small spiritual
    pain. Branches grow thick and very large leaves with crimson edges ... miles upon
    miles of dead white acacias... this summer seems also to be a kind of disease
    like all those seasons threatened by its own imminence ... an abrupt dream; a
    collapsed house; unburied bones: winter which happens beneath our teetering feet.
    The edge... its shade exhausts itself. The opening goes out beyond what was borne
    time ago an already deployed vision (whose residue remains vigilant in those shivers)'
