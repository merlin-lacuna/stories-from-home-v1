  act1descr: 'ACT1: The land''s ecoystem is slowly deteriorating but the flora and
    fauna of the land are adapting to these changes. The land gradually realises that

    seems to arise anew from every segment of its surface like an epiphany from the
    unknown.\nURBAN:'
  act2descr: 'ACT2: The flora and fauna of the land is are slowly withering and dying
    and the ecosystem is becoming very unstable. The absence of copmanion-elements
    is now creating turbulent influences on the land that is no longer in complete
    command of itself. Unforeseen and unknown phenomena now regulate its rhythm and
    existence. It is a totally unfathomable universe and nothing seems to be cyclical
    anymore.\nURBAN:'
  act3descr: 'ACT3: The land has lost more flora and fauna than it has ever lost before
    in its lifetime. It is on the verge of becoming devoid of any flora and fauna
    whatsoever. The land finds itself deprived of its vivid lovers and blooming companions.
    Sterility now appears to be its ultimate destination, and all around reigns a
    silence with mortiferous overtones. The condition of absence casts a shadow of
    despair on its entire extension.\nURBAN:'
