My ecology is diverse, from the forests to the fields, birds singing sweet melodies, butterflies fluttering with glee. I am blessed with fertile soil, that nourishes my crops and trees, my beauty is not just skin deep, but a reflection of my history. I am the land of myths and legends, where stories are woven into my fabric and my beauty is truly enchanting.'
