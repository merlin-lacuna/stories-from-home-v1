  bio: 'I am a brittle and searing forest. I’ve been getting warmer and warmer and
    I’m incredibly thirsty. I need water but I hardly get any. '

  type: Forest
prompt:
  act0descr: 'ACT0: The forest''s burning fire is not yet known. The
    forest introduces itself and describes its surroundings.\nFOREST: '
  act1descr: 'ACT1: The forest has been severely burned. Forest fires have consumed
    a huge chunk of the forest. The forest experiences that all around unknown sharp
    entities of almost liquid heat are ruthlessly surging forward, dispossessing its
    presence and dismantling its vital force with their consistency. They are flames
    rising unannounced from the soil and besieging inexorably the branches, putting
    the flowing lymph into a blaze of pure destruction.\nFOREST: '
  act2descr: 'ACT2: The forest has barely started to recover from a disastrous forest
    fire. The forest senses that its leaves are suffocating, surrounded by a thick,
    opaque haze. The fume mantle is apparently bent on no longer allowing the sunlight
    to reach the forest''s previously lush extensions. Everything grows fuzzy, the
    trunks creak at the dawn of an impending end.\nFOREST: '
  act3descr: 'ACT3: The forest is making surprisingly fast progress in regrowing
    vegetation after a destructive forest fire. The forest is reduced to the mere
    surfacing of its roots. The earth''s desiccation has supplanted the luxurious
    ecosystem of organisms originally in harmony. All turns into stillness, and the
    forest whispers in the breeze its generous legacy to the universe, wishing to
    bloom anew.\nFOREST: '
  intro: 'The following play reveals the inner monologue of a dry smoldering forest.
    It is divided into several acts. Throughout these acts, the forest describes its
    inner and outer transformation:\n\nThe first act starts like this:\n\n'
