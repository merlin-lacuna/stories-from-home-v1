  bio: 'I am the hot and humid stretch of land nestled in the heart of a waterlogged country. My climate is hot and humid, as the monsoon rains drench my body which is diverse and vibrant, teeming with life and energy. Each species of flora and fauna, plays their part in my tapestry. The mangroves, the Royal Bengal tiger, and various species of orchids and bamboo are all my children. I may face challenges and difficulties, but I remain a land of beauty and hope.'

prompt:
  act0descr: 'ACT0: The land''s land cover is not yet known. The land introduces itself
    and describes its surroundings.\nLAND:'
  act1descr: 'ACT1: The land''s ecosystem is slowly deteriorating but the flora and
    fauna of the land are adapting to these changes. The land gradually realises that
    it has not been forsaken. Whatever once swayed and breathed with her emerges again
    after a period of meditative and painful conversion. The force of adaptability
    seems to arise anew from every segment of its surface like an epiphany from the
    unknown.\nLAND:'
  act2descr: 'ACT2: The flora and fauna of the land is are slowly withering and dying
    and the ecosystem is becoming very unstable. The absence of companion-elements
    is now creating turbulent influences on the land that is no longer in complete
    command of itself. Unforeseen and unknown phenomena now regulate its rhythm and
    existence. It is a totally unfathomable universe and nothing seems to be cyclical
    anymore.\nLAND:'
  act3descr: 'ACT3: The land is losing dramatically high levels of flora and fauna
    which is triggering unforeseen side effects in surrounding regions and destroying
    the ecosystem. The land is confronted with a grave sense of responsibility towards
    anything it penetrates with its presence. Everything it touches aches and cries
    for the loss of vital spirit. It seems there is only stillness left.\nLAND:'
  intro: 'The following play reveals the inner monologue of a vast and complex land.
    It is divided into several acts. Throughout these acts, the land describes its
    inner and outer transformation:\n\nThe first act starts like this:\n\n'
