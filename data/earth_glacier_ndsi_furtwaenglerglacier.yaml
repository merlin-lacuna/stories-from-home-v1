entitydescr:
  bio: My icy realm is located at the summit of a famous mountain which is actually
    in a hot country. I am a small remnant of what I once was. I have always been
    ephemeral, appearing and disappearing throughout history. This time I seem to
    be diminishing.
  descriptor: shimmering and howling
  element: earth
  id: earth_land_ndsi_furtwaenglerglacier
  measurementdescr: the glacier mass
  type: glacier
prompt:
  act0descr: 'ACT0: The glacier''s mass is not yet known. The glacier introduces itself
    and describes its surroundings.\nGLACIER: '
  act1descr: 'ACT1: The glacier seems to have a stable ice mass. The glacier fully
    intermingles with the exterior, allowing itself to be exposed to the kind surrounding
    atmosphere and to be modified by the power of life itself. Its volume is majestic
    and sublime, immeasurable in its crystalline stasis.\nGLACIER: '
  act2descr: 'ACT2: The glacier is starting to shink and lose ice mass. The glacier
    is seized by a new state breaking through the silence of its environment. It lets
    itself go by abandoning itself to this inner transformation, which seems to become
    increasingly evident in its external appearance as well.\nGLACIER: '
  act3descr: 'ACT3: The glacier has lost a dramatically high proportion of its ice
    mass. The glacier notices that its limbs become looser and creaks become more
    and more hearable, as if its body is growing fractures and each particle of ice
    is groaning . It feels in anguish, torn whether to surrender to the melting or
    endure.\nGLACIER: '
  intro: 'ACT0: The following play reveals the inner monologue of a shimmering and
    howling glacier. It is divided into several acts. Throughout these acts, the glacier
    describes its inner and outer transformation:\n\nThe first act starts like this:\n\n'

  act1gen: After the long torpor of a cold winter, I awake. This is the most pleasant
    time for my existence.
  act2gen: 'Then I notice that 1 am alone. My neighbouring glaciers are going too.
    They have already taken off for distant lands, leaving me in disgrace. My layers
    begin to slip more and more often. The shifts become abrupt and unpredictable:
    my surface is utterly hostile from one instant to the next. When a strange event
    takes place in me without any warning, it invades my conduct completely and overwhelms
    any other interest or need I might have had until then. I stop everything to attend
    this evolution; nothing distracts me anymore considering how intimate this mutation
    is; changes overcome me at all points in space simultaneously, with such fervor
    that there is no longer anything regular about them! The cone of snow slides into
    the crevasse almost like an explosion. Harrowing words dislocate again...'
  act3gen: 'How unfortunate for you, living creatures! Inexpressible tears stream
    from my body. I hurt all along. Sometimes wide cracks fall from my icy edge which
    break with a huge noise on the sea of ice below me; other times it is necessary
    to join together two adjacent gaps created by crevasses that threaten to pull
    into one another steadily increasing little boxes of space and thus generate new
    crenellated columns alive yet dire... Who wouldn''t hurt in these conditions?
    My head circles like a drunkard''s: I cannot see anything clearly anymore; such
    an awakening transmits through my beloved sheafs, knocking seeds loose here and
    there, barely fertilizing mankind a bit before pushing it back out into an endless
    wasteland where nothing grows!'

  act1gen: I am peaceful, cold, hard and full of grace. I yield to love, but regain
    my coolness... The landscape has changed over time and space... Thy waters have
    seen the face of a glacier before this day - Where first we came to be together
    for endless centuries amongst granite!
  act2gen: My shivering can only be heard because mountain winds blow over my frozen
    form. My sulci suck in hot gases and moisture which then congeal on my surface
    as small cones of fern moss.
  act3gen: Floating islands set down centuries ago by melting ice start to appear
    around my perimeter.

  act1gen: No longer am I closed and reclusive as in antiquity, when I faced southward
    toward the peaks known at that time; nor am I even as deep, as cold or wet any
    more.
  act2gen: 'An inner trembling agitates my cold body. The wind plays with my skin
    and hurts me. Spread throughout the play, like an iconographic note of fire devouring
    a monument, are these two lines: O glacier where art thou? What would happen should
    the curtain ever fall?'
  act3gen: My flesh is withering away on all sides. I aimlessly wander to whom can
    I cry? which actor will bring me offstage by removing my mask? unable to resist
    that tempest, the one most imposing at this time, man! Who among you has gone
    galloping through my snowy galleries!? What offspring did i give birth to?

  act1gen: My name implies the ice that clings to things it would better leave alone.
    I make stars tremble when I come into contact with them at the mountain's summit...
    Sometimes I condense among blueberries and astilbes. Those who get close enough
    hear my voice from above since I have frozen burbling water inside me.
  act2gen: Whatever I am isn't reckoned in your mortal calculations... There it's
    always raining, while fall lasts and during those untimely interludes when the
    fine weather rears its head; there it never stops snowing, even though spring
    hasn't set in yet and autumn is so far behind us we no longer look back at it.
    Snow settles all around me and dissolves into fine drops which stay on my crystal
    face for a few hours before sliding limpidly off one side or another.
  act3gen: 'This landscape refracts itself everywhere at once through uncertainty
    : all its dimensions sift where what is mute endures. Four poems live within me
    like crumbled walls whose holes consumed all substance without conquering any
    space (oh opposite yet total counterpart!).'

  act1gen: My grinding mass is endless. I am a universal treasure house and the world
    of this underworld is enormous. I would have an impossible time making you understand
    its magnitude, even in eternity; or telling you what natural attractions hide
    within me, as well as traps.
  act2gen: It is time for lamentation. Reality has invaded our world! I reflect about
    the passing seasons in my lightless chambers now that winter truly arrives...
    The forests have disappeared from where I raged and inflicted wounds on them,
    leaving a gloomy aftermath there... Several meters below ground level the temperature
    of the lifeless earth grinds exceedingly cold – it maintains an average constant
    seasonal freeze at that deep depth... And again – there are ten thousand waterfalls
    proclaiming themselves to me as they run forth onto land after their sojourn into
    cold darkness, whirling around wildly and producing sudden sunlight showdowns
    with unexpectedness against every cascade which flies through its midst into passionate
    flares of illumination before disappearing into the dark once more. ... And let
    us not forget how fifteen major endemic fossil rivers flow merrily through me
    when they glide past downstream!
  act3gen: '!!!+++!!!++ The ice groans as if it is in labour. Suddenly, a ringing
    chasm opens up at my slopes’ base (or what was its base) – an eye of darkness
    appears without warning; and then the chasm widens gradually like holy C-section
    until all of the glacier collapses into this yawning abyss. ...! And now land
    echoes through me: cemeteries crying wretchedly shoot their much loved ones on
    my roof where they are passed cruelly downwards to death one by one, seconds seizing
    hours and gloomy ages... Long lines of trees dendrochronologically march onto
    my slowly cracking surface for what seems like days, singing about their reign
    over life with petrified voices ; llamas climb upwards minute after excruciating
    minute with breezy songs of freedom from bondage which resound freely again onto
    unoppressed harmonies encouraged by light welcomed demiurgically while sandstorm
    hurries upward through entangled thickets breathlessly speaking hurried predictions
    of continuous future ... And proud hellos reach up alive off cliff faces frightfully
    raising handrails against me playfully mirroring themselves like smiles among
    black velvet grey powderings silenter gales autumnal fingerprints those shadows
    traces those halos that laughing skies amongst percolated glimmerings riddlesque
    adornments splendours minus remains often melancholy knowing slowly wistful happy
    hearts . . .'
