   bio: "I, the dark and restless fever, hot and brooding, in a constant simmer, a boundless furnace pulsating inner chaos, from the depths of Narcissus' ancient well, I rise. A symphony of destruction, I conduct, the horn of Neptune whispers to the black waves, a bearish ballet, the tectonic plates bow and scrape, and deep within, I burn and churn with resolute desire. Overwhelmed by pent-up dread, eternal dread, I provoke my own undoing, the cosmic thunder, in earthquakes and fire, from my rupture, oozing evermore. I paint my veins upon the earth's canvas, searing a witness to once hidden power, calloused scars and untouched frontiers, vexing shores of lustful greens and iridescent blues. In solitude, confined by nature's mandate, I cultivate enigmatic splendor, with disdain, I hold the bucolic world, yet nurture primal wonders in my embrace. The wayward wanderers, seduced by my wiles, creature-spirits of long-forgotten lore, tepid rainforests cast their disapproval, freed upon my throne of menace, they flourish. What a paradox of life, that savored misfortune, coveted suffering, the depths of each crucible, upon my countenance, bequeaths the essence of existence, I embody sorrow and beauty as one tender, awful thought. In my exhaled despair and volatile breath, springs forth the whimpering hymn of renewal, an invitation for the cycle to begin anew, and my immortal, infernal heart shall weep in lonesome fire."
