  bio: I am a mountainous region that enjoys heavy snowfall during the winter months.
    Some call me Snow Country. I''m surrounded by beautiful nature and the summer
    season reveals lush rice fields all over my body. By body is also criss-crossed
    by many hiking trails and covered with forests.

  intro: The following play reveals the inner monologue of a lush and mountainous.
    It is divided into several acts. Throughout these acts, the land describes its

  act1gen: I have received the snowflakes that fall from above. They started to pile
    up on me and in just one night my body was blanketed with a layer of intensely
    soft, feathery powder. Snow!
  act2gen: 'A compassionate God, why do you act with this inalterable sameness?

    AG: \"ln the beginning was Snow and the Bird of Thunder.\" Don''t be afraid, my
    Creation; though your knowledge can''t reach to those heights - I will say more.
    The blessed Jesus has appeared among us to make known heaven''s ways `and this
    is what he said: AG:''Tlam your only Sun heard before creation, sung by night.
    ...The waters I scattered over time until they ch0ked themselves on land.| \\''e''ve
    outstretched our wings without ever bending them! We have kept firm on a path
    strewn with myrtles and irises that grew up for me because of love for you!''
    It took man long enough to learn about my Providence And discover within himself
    \hat high Command majestically governs him.'' Everything you created pulsates
    with spiritual wisdom, beloved Land; calmly wait then, mild creature - it shall
    come! Ah yes .. . today while leading his disciples he said: ?Ì''ll f:''ebreaking
    sound lnto roots always troubled by lack of sleep ...You desire light away from
    meat-eating hours but winter shields it w~th her breast sky-blue like wet stone._\
    On Sunday when·.. ! knew these words This snow came down onto me which weighed
    as heavily as an interminably cold future threat if I didn''t hold very still
    as if a bronze statue!'
  act3gen: 'A compassionate God, why but the ver~e beauty of its grayish blue sky
    that sways so nobly toward the earth? AG: W here do you see blue sky? The springtime
    is there! It has come tearing out from underground - have a look! Look at my face
    in which I welcome it with infinitely great tenderness. ...Ah my son, never forget
    what I tell you: there is nothing gentler than Snow and Air; now do not abandon
    me in this hour of transformation.Â A colorful succession brims-over on the land''s
    surface stirred by powerful tremors. lt continues to breathe following rhe rhythm
    oE''rhe falling snowflakes. A muffled atmosphere unfolds all around, and winter
    blazes in all its white energy. \Vhite winds barely stir with their wings his
    happiness so long awaited doesn''t last very long .. . Ah yes we are moving away
    inexorably from childhood! Or when else were summers as poor as th ese times?'

  act1gen: I am Snow Country. I constantly juxtapose white against green colors as
    nature seasonally changes on my surface. My land opens through its snow layer
    to study itself and observes that what is buried changes under uncertainty of
    seasons. North of me lies a most exquisite lake, but fall arrives each year; before
    leaf peeping time comes around again, one winter after another at last lays waste
    to the shallow water until it completely disappears into Earth with no trace left
    behind; only turquoise butterflies are scattered about lonely shores! And hard
    times come for those living thereabouts when luck no longer smiles upon them!
    It's later than you think! As soon as the eye sees something lovely ahead, but
    oh how easy it is for beauty ever so gently stolen from us to melt away without
    getting noticed until too late! While we glance elsewhere, an entire lifetime
    can unexpectedly elapse right beneath our eyes without our even noticing its whizzing
    past!!
  act2gen: 'One of the dark stories spoken here has to do with lacerations and exile:
    a story, who or what it is that carries these wounds either lasts, unwinds in
    their irreparable distance; we suffer from this forgetting (the disappearance
    haunts) it chivalry for to illuminate a people might not bythe mind be such neither
    suffering nor misery. If my "reason" does not bother about being born today would
    be illuminated for us must first because at study and vision did muddle hardly
    separate be indeed reexamined and constituted before reaching critical moments
    - no thought intervenes there - so desperate enough enlightened reason, (which
    appears each time most sacred when was indeed savored and the oMiginatFor here
    opens But bitterness against itself endures), so abandoned to lawlessness: death
    erases will always blood vessels anarchic pains So our pain belongs Lately to
    an old At what price remove them now? Light on landscapes night destini ality
    more faint frozen summers. All too evasive poison mist ... Infertility rocks Now
    tied fast To oblivion drunkenness Do people follow? Goodby eternal youth! What
    does Wherefore the snow?!'
  act3gen: 'Determination strivings, ordeals, How steep the road that ascends for
    each one of us! Let there not succeed to be arrogance nor immorality here::''
    For what reward could we dare ask to so refine our approach if naivety already
    covers us? Visible: intensity and its flattery. Last time - was not inconsolable
    past sorrow glorious? ("Cascade";) The shared grief surprises me; l become tranquil.
    My secret torrent holds back sud denly before you " - But only the night knows
    quiet solitude; dawn disperses a person''''s prayers from another age where poignant
    eyes observed realization does smile goodnight chaos into dawn ... on high. My
    illuminated words are sundered by your heart; without day. yoU resemble rain ...
    What exists but disillusioned eternity That ravages everything in turn just like
    war forever consuming itself to conquer eternity ...'

  act1gen: It is winter. Snow fell intensely on the last day and its blanket covers
    the land. Today I am immersed in this snow, which moistens my soil with a layer
    several inches deep . . . Very late at night I dream of summer under clear skies;
    but when finally late afternoon comes, how beautiful it is to watch those heavy
    downfalls of drifting snow that sparkle in all directions!
  act2gen: 'The entire stage is in darkness; moonlight caresses my skin, which radiates
    its heavy snows toward the audience. It is night-time again; I am covered with
    a thick blanket of snow and await spring so that the soil can break through! It
    is full daylight: my soil has broken through and I now display fertile rice paddies
    all over myself. En didacticism scorches itself dry every coup de pinceau to be
    quickly substituted with poetics which then governs the fields of each acts  .
    . . We have to discover flowers possessing vitality beneath our own feet ... for
    we are Toussenel there .. :'' The rhythmicality of time tides back and forth.'
  act3gen: 'It is a bright day: my soil emerges free of snow. How beautiful it is
    to see myself covered with young pines, green pasturelands and seas of corn! This
    rhythm causes the earth''s respiration to persist, revealing an economy that maintains
    pace with the differentiation into several pastures. The deep roots of being cannot
    however claim irreducible diversity but only homologous transformations (or stable
    variants): Between eternity that excludes surprises and obviousness which never
    surprises, intention overcomes ossification through restlessness. An immediate
    linearity-disabling whereby today cancels yesterday, just as tomorrow detaches
    itself from today in turn; reputedly we distinct poetically throughout succession
    and simultaneity without denying duration or disabling its manner.'

  act1gen: White describes me the way music and flags do. I'm swamped in immaculacy,
    sanctified by fresh coldness. My gusts don't bite like yours; they relax me, caress
    my hair and neck with invisible fingers, touch me gentle l per as you melt into
    sweet bubbles of silver/shapes far beyond your reach (all this depicted at the
    bottom part), fall slowly here where ice blinks under my feet; but these sad samples
    won't suffice for, you now, there isn't anything to catch hold of -you wouldn't
    see what happens to you.
  act2gen: I'll take your hand, but you're part of my whiteness, I kiss you and erode;
    time goes by - never have I been so abandoned to ice. Behind glass something marvelous
    is taking place. But that's not this here where the snowflakes land without stop
    (all around them shimmering frozen stars in constellations that propose to increase)..wait.
    The only player is night, a combed dark and scree chisteling with ease on my forehead;
    sometimes a star slips into me whhen space grapples with its pitchy sharer - Oh
    infinite voyage! To follow me for an instant on one side. I noticed how meteor
    families scurry about.
  act3gen: 'She, who doesn''t exist any more, wants to kill me. She didn''t want,
    no longer desires the cold of winter: So she removed herself from fashion and
    went back in time. Today is the twenty-fifth year since her disappearance. To
    cultivate hatred - that''s what my tyrant does; knowing it impossible for the
    snowflakes to end one day soon our wintertime separation (the fruit and foliage
    I offer won''t supplant this tragedy), how can we ever forgive each other? A condition
    tickles my clarity with its furor! Most greetful are your white strata, always
    something here is willing you good fortune but every summer a rustling rosebush
    stifles you as well as Confusion - so much so: Confusion?'

  act1gen: 'Here I am. My pure white ladies touch my face, caress me tenderly and
    smile broadly. The parks bask in a snowy flood; darkness falleth on light which
    bids farewell to my breast. Where else can you find such magical scenes? Troops
    of fish swim upstream here during summer, come winter they swim downstream: ''Tis
    our season!’ sings the spider king as he builds a web that fills an entire room
    one whole day long. ‘Separated from us, people weep bitterly among waves jingling
    fiercely with frost and icy rocks!’ Short-legged crabs conceal themselves into
    small round holes dug deep into the ground where grassroots murmur and shoot up
    delicately all over my body like dancing hellbenders, purple bell flowers dazzle
    at dawn just about when fireflies show off their sparks flying wildly about for
    no apparent reasons hour after hour until night plants its cold lips upon them
    all – Oh flying sparks! You live but momentarily only because your purpose is
    fulfilled only temporarily: your lives depend on mine!'
  act2gen: 'Snow is actually a monotonous idea! The landscape is transmuted by the
    new beauty of this sheet of cold purity – but an annoying voice incongruously
    pitches itself in, suddenly. The same thing every year just about when we want
    to escape you! I’ve heard your carolling already for many years: what does your
    everlasting lullaby mean? It dismisses us from fairyland because we don’t expect
    anything from you; and freezing half to death, what do we owe you that one must
    always endure winter with its accompanying displeasure?! Your dreams are as slippery
    as fish eggs because each time they tell us lies!: One cannot help being discouraged
    by You: on our feet all through the summer long and suddenly comes a fat frost
    lump which swallows up everything without asking if there was something else too.
    Night dives inside my mouth while nearby dawn rings hands all alone in vain with
    empty clothes. ... What has happened to me?! Open my eyes so I may look at who
    attacked me: snow which enters rough and rude like dirty boiling water-spew ,
    burns my skin bit by bit until nothing remains except smoking bones. And then
    where can we go save home?'
  act3gen: 'Land, Frozen, won''t say a thing. (Slight laugh) Rely on me and I''ll
    lead you over the edge of the world!


    (Rumbling noise for some seconds.) Long Live Cryostasis! More exact than science,
    more poisonous than a confused sunbeam from outer space, Time freezes everyone
    here in order to sculpt him alive. ...'
