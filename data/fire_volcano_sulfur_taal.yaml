   bio: "I, the voiceless whisper, undulating serpentine embrace, in the fervent grasp of obsidian slumber. Wet whispers seduce the sultry air, frivolously casting soft tendrils, shimmering through the veiled membrane, flickering betwixt the folds of ebullient plume. Emerald blades tint with flick'ring tips, where kisses of scarlet lips arise, the palm tree's fingers sway besotted, a sensual symphony of shivering delight. The sun, though obscured, pierces the humid veil with outstretch'd flame, impaling exuberant foliage, entranced, a feast of lupine tongues unfolding. When moonlight caresses the placid reflection, away I steal, a nocturnal lover, insidious claws caress the untamed, scratching the firmament of voluptuous night. Oh, streams of fleeting ecstasy, that quiver in silk-spun rapture, twirling to the diaphanous gaze of Orion, I am the eldritch dreamer, the desirous weaver threading amidst, golden slumber and hallowed whispers, a somber symphony of transient woe. As cicada song descends to murmurs, and brazen raindrops dare to invade, I, the voiceless whisper, whirl wild, in the ancient ink of solitude, unraveling sinewy threads of obsidian silence, in the cradle of the unknown."
