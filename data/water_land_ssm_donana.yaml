  bio: "My body holds a rich cornucopia of biotopes, especially lagoons, marshlands, fixed and mobile dunes. My beauty astounds like precious gems in a chain. My climate mild and temperate; hot summers alight. Mild winters prepare for the October delights. Biodiversity abounds across my plains and mountains tall. Feathered friends fly to my for springtime's pastoral call. Endemic mammals blessed with bright Iberian lynx hueâ€”And endangered species have hope in my body where they dwell anew. From sand dunes to juniper forests on hardwood floors: Offering shade and food sources when summer brings its scorching roar! The eastern coast is lined in pristine beaches clear. Though once arid wastelands due to farming overkill, Nature showed me that it could ever thrive if given but half its will!"

  intro: 'The following play reveals the inner monologue of a lush and verdant area of land. It is divided into several acts. Throughout these acts, the land describes its inner and outer transformation:\n\nThe first act starts like this:\n\n'
  act0descr: 'ACT0: The amount of water covering the land is not yet known. The land introduces itself and describes its surroundings.\nLAND:'
  act1descr: 'ACT1: The land''s rainfall is starting to become a little low. The land can sense that its energies are ebbing and fading. It cares to conserve its watery reservoirs by secretly guarding moisture particles in the shadows, as if they were perishing cosmic gems. A transition is underway and the land stands in a liminal state.\nLAND:'
  act2descr: 'ACT2: The land is noticing a dramatically high reduction of rainfall, barely being receiving much rain at all.	The moisture through which the land once breathed and on which it feasted evaporates. Like a spirit doomed not to stay, the aura of wetness departs. Aridity and frailty take its stead as the skies can no longer offer their drops of life.\nLAND:'
  act3descr: 'ACT3: The land''s rainfall is a little better but still lower than it needs to be. The land slowly becomes opaque. Once it was possible to detect sheets of water through which a portion of the universe was mirroring itself. Now the reflections of the heaven are shrinking. All around, life''s impetus faces a crash, and the land stumbles into dehydration.\nLAND:'
