  bio: The air above me feels sultry and subtropical. I experience very mild winters
    and hot, rainy, and muggy summers. From where I lie, I can see the South China
    Sea, and I am almost touch my neighbour, the Pearl River Delta. My body is lined
    with hills and forests and my coastline is long and fragmented, splitting off
    into numerous islands.

  act0descr: 'ACT0: The land''s rainfall is not yet known. The land introduces itself
    and describes its surroundings.\nLAND: '
  act1descr: 'ACT1: The land''s rainfall is starting to become a little high. The
    land can sense that its energies are ebbing and fading. It cares to conserve its
    watery reservoirs by secretly guarding moisture particles in the shadows, as if
    they were perishing cosmic gems. A transition is underway and the land stands
    in a liminal state.\nLAND: '
  act2descr: 'ACT2: The land''s rainfall is extremely high. The precipitation is at
    unprecedented levels.  The land is no further capable of embracing, sustaining
    and shoring up its surroundings. Everything is fractured, brittle and in a precarious
    state of disarray. The process of displacement and disconnection from the world
    appears imminent while fragility abounds.\nLAND: '
  act3descr: 'ACT3: The land''s rainfall has returned to normal levels The land is
    elastic and smooth, it resonates with harmonious resilience to both outward and
    inward impulses. It is apt to cradle and nurture its encircling landscapes. The
    soil shaping its presence is salubrious and bursting with scintillating strength.
    The humidity gives birth to iridescent veins within the terrain.\nLAND: '
  intro: The following play reveals the inner monologue of a rich and complex land.
    It is divided into several acts. Throughout these acts, the land describes its
    inner and outer transformation:\n\nThe first act starts like this:\n\n

  act2gen: Tears collected in a cupform, dripping from their decaying watery rims.
  act3gen: ' “lucky”; sapphire: “the night has fallen,/ my blissful sword will be
    your shield.” The formless face of sadness momentarily coldly seen in the glass
    and then … a hand raised to still its obscure movements. Ah! To wield that vain
    enigmatic gesture another time only if given endless centuries with which to accomplish
    those seconds at one''s disposal.'

- act1gen: It is marvellous to be close and yet far from the tranquillity on the other
    side of China, in Hong Kong. My rainy glades gleam with jewels of stagnant water
    among rotting palmettos and tangled bamboos, amid beds of convolvulus partially
    obscuring the remains (fragments) of old brick walls surrounding forgotten villas.
    But not all my virtues are merely primitive and unrefined; I am also a city built
    in Chinese style along broad avenues shaded by trees.

  act3gen: 'Night binds me in a firm, nightly embrace the week before autumn arrives.
    I am no primitive peasant who, lost and anxious through lack of experience or
    knowledge about what comes after rain for a dry land that awaits its own time,
    nestles up to the boy he loves so as not to feel cold and sheeple.'' The [essence]
    of my hand clings like ivy hanging over old houses, while my soul resembles an
    oriental miniature painting portraying fair maidens sitting beneath trees doing
    embroidery and spinning thread reassuringly beside refreshing fountains.

    IVERSE: We see things truly with our feelings; it is only then that we understand
    objects by experiencing them with some sense beyond the five senses.'

- act1gen: I have one foot in the tropics and another in temperate climes. The soft,
    damp south-east wind occasionally blows cold from the geomantic North; here where
    it is always so hot, because of that strange kindling sun, even at night it seems
    to be summer.

  act3gen: "The quiet rivers burst with vitality and explode in peals of green cascades;
    between blue, gold and a silver-green grow yellow trees along the little paths
    once trodden by romantic love …\n Amongst the thick undergrowth on stony plots
    beside bright ponds, set deep into humid banks beneath woven silks shielding arboreal
    canopies atop multi-coloured towers that stiffen scenic panoramas from inside
    ancient walls contructed to withstand moments of abandonment stand fresh springs
    gushing aromatic water. My shady corners are filled with my nights full moon."

    altered. As I slowly grow in size and content with the passing of years, the tension
    created by my very existence puts a damper on myself.

  act3gen: 'I am the feel of full-bodied grapes pressed beneath rough, curved hands!
    I''m where on a still evening aroma rises into one''s nostrils from dark blocks
    of flavor.

    I belong to those who work plowing and clearing out overgrown forestland for paths
    in the mountain wilds. The turquoise waters of my lakes prolong themselves out
    through me. My slim branches are bored by bees extracting honey from where it
    seeps/and old songbirds that sing prayers as they fly around hemmed in by reeds
    and some willow trees./But that is neither here nor there; existence works when
    unconscious things need explanations … But even then, does life exist? Life exists
    within myself because if it did not I would not be myself: A natural piece with
    each thing being connected without being necessary … Each autonomous and alone
    but wanting company nevertheless!/Does what we cling onto exist? Yes ­ so long
    as we agree to believe it! What is left after all these years doesn''t have to
    have an independent existence: once reality has been denied, nothing remains except
    memory or something close to memory … Does anything really matter because nothing
    matters any more at all?'

    ACT 4 This stage involves addressing the fate of small rural villages and sleepy
    hamlets strewn throughout life's large meanderings. The land welcomes like a giant
    betwixt its limbs these tender buds that are people and memories, holding them
    fast as nature intensifies all appetites for growth, energy and spontaneity: there
    should not be violence or melancholy down at this level. Life has abandoned my
    field to floods and muds; someone needs to come over here in person who will bother?
    What could I possibly have offered anyone in return for their attention amid tasks
    they find repugnant?"

- act1gen: 'My speech is a history of humidity and exudes the eternal smell and color
    of new leaves.

    I live on, immobile, my soul rooted in dead layers like rippled algae or patches
    of mildew. But no matter how still I am, there are things that never cease moving
    inside me: enormous birds circle ceaselessly over the topography outlining my
    skyline; ships from China and Portugal spend whole days offloading cargo at my
    docks on Ba-sio River (with esplanades packed full with people); Macau (which
    wasn''t born) plays out its silent life by the tea light of lamps only visible
    to those leaning out through windows hung with curtains above narrow streets winding
    round other streets threatening to become too small for them all … Each evening,
    the western sun slowly reddens into an infinity untouched by human beings. In
    doing so, it constitutes another episode in the lengthy acte gratuit which is
    my existence without meaning because nothing happens there except what always
    happened here stretching back into time where I have presumed nonexistent certainties.'

  act3gen: 'What I was, what I am, will perhaps be only a longing unknown to me for
    when we are no longer here, not even memories remain … A giant cradle slowly rocked
    by the sun and stars with ourselves as infants sleeping calm … In our dry beds
    among uncertain waters numb paddling dust on subterranean streams dragged from
    improvised banks into forgotten lakes where yellow reeds burst up thick knowing
    that underneath somewhere unseen everything dies but rises again just as it was:
    freaks of growth or ageing flames everything is shapely at times in itself.

    But you can visit me lethargic and light if you walk along Ba-sio River. The esplanades
    surrounding the quayside crammed full with dusk require less effort than life.'

    calcium carbonate, marl and other types of minerals are expensively scattered
    upon my surface and they never really fuse together except in rare or exceptional
    situations. I change with the seasons, but always remain myself, whether kind
    or cruel to those who dwell within me: o silent land where night falls early!

  act2gen: 'The breeze in the furnace of my still, quiet air moves me. I am full of
    concealed universes and ripe promises rejoicing among themselves, bringing themselves
    to fruition. It only feels as if it''s autumn but with a hint of nascent summer
    inside what little summer remains. Nameless appearances irrigate infinite landscapes
    that scatter out over all directions: o dull land where night falls early! Because
    the rainfall has reached an extremely high level; floods have occurred or are
    about to occur throughout vast areas rivers overspill their banks and run wild
    into valleys far from anything supporting them; much of the earth changes style,
    its delineation forever lost from sight now submerged below swelling pools … If
    these last two sentences seem incongruous to you, please bear with me for one
    more instant.'
  act3gen: Early sunset brings the passage from autumn to winter. If you look carefully,
    the ground appears momentarily frozen and cracked. I slumber under an invisible
    feel ing of distress … My hills enjoy a feeble fertility. Often, out walking my
    deserted valleys at nightfall along these ancient roads through which no one passes,
    withering emotions take hold around me like dead leaves in well-worn grooves that
    no cart has ever gone down … } More kilometers of erratic woodland than exist
    between me and human dwellings! A traditional spring revitalizes the land enabling
    it once more on its slow awakening towards what is essential in life; upward they
    rise again myriad weeds like those ancient voices never heard before or forgot
    ten years ago succumbing to unquenched thirst with roots seeking water in that
    soil once relatively irrigated by divine begettings superior forgotten gods known
    only to slaves not yet decided into what solitary continuum refracts their disheveled
    essence?

- act1gen: The air above me is becoming torpid and hot.
  act2gen: In some parts it actually floods, covering cities under a sheet of water.
    In others fields dissolve into mud and its forests start to fray at their very
    roots.
  act3gen: 'Clean, colorful forests litter my furthest reaches. Enormous, painstaking
    fields of grain and rich crops pinch themselves out spontaneously across the contours
    of my land mass. The water buffets its way through the riverbanks, chops up into
    different identities to help create new islands in me.


    I arise from all these things as a unified figure which is always changing but
    never ends up disappearing altogether or becoming something else entirely … Or
    does it? I don''t know what times or seasons are appropriate for this uncertainty
    that fills me with longing.

    AND ES PRESENTES All this occurs twenty-four hours before everything disappears
    into oblivion … Where will I go? If everyone one day had to leave here forever
    would they accept that existence? So many disquieting thoughts! And among them
    you also feel sorry for those who tomorrow must disappear as well And what about
    today''s bread if no hands reach out to bring it nearer? In some sad corner lost
    in the chaos of losing one''s keys full of dreams there resound voices saying:
    \ A despair without reason draws us still farther downwards towards the black
    sea lurking deep beneath our uncertain steps.'

- act1gen: The air above me feels even more sultry and subtropical. I experience very
    mild winters and humid, rainy summers. Worldly processes occasionally corrode
    this corrosion, ending in yet another layer of dust on my eczema.
  act2gen: The air above me is almost entirely sultry and subtropical. Whenever rain
    falls onto my ulcerous body, I scream with furious rage.
  act3gen: 'The air above me jocund with joy, bequeaths consoling rains of life onto
    my bony brow. I experience warm winters and barely-noticeable summers. It is a
    voluptuous equilibrium that finds its place among the surroundings: earth, water,
    wind and plants.


    The masses are often afraid they might have insufficient spiritual nutrition to
    survive; thus they seek things wrongly. They dream of leaving their age behind
    in order utterly to transform it. As if one could escape in time! How much effort
    must there not be when everything here below has already been spent on analogous
    worries?'
