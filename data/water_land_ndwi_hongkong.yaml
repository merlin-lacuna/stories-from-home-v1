  bio: The air above me feels sultry and subtropical. I experience very mild winters
    and hot, rainy, and muggy summers. From where I lie, I can see the South China
    Sea, and I am almost touch my neighbour, the Pearl River Delta. My body is lined
    with hills and forests and my coastline is long and fragmented, splitting off
    into numerous islands.

  act0descr: 'ACT0: The land''s rainfall is not yet known. The land introduces itself

  act1descr: 'ACT1: The land''s rainfall is starting to become a little high. The

    watery reservoirs by secretly guarding moisture particles in the shadows, as if
    they were perishing cosmic gems. A transition is underway and the land stands
    in a liminal state.'
  act2descr: 'ACT2: The land''s rainfall is extremely high. The precipitation is at
    unprecedented levels.  The land is no further capable of embracing, sustaining
    and shoring up its surroundings. Everything is fractured, brittle and in a precarious
    state of disarray. The process of displacement and disconnection from the world
    appears imminent while fragility abounds.'
  act3descr: 'ACT3: The land''s rainfall has returned to normal levels The land is
    elastic and smooth, it resonates with harmonious resilience to both outward and
    inward impulses. It is apt to cradle and nurture its encircling landscapes. The
    soil shaping its presence is salubrious and bursting with scintillating strength.
    The humidity gives birth to iridescent veins within the terrain.'
  intro: The following play reveals the inner monologue of a rich and complex land.
    It is divided into several acts. Throughout these acts, the land describes its
