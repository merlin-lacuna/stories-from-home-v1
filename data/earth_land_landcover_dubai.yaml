entitydescr:
  bio: I have a climate that is mostly warm and sunny, with some moderate humidity.
    I am one of the driest places on Earth, rain rarely graces me with its presence
    and the oldest rocks on my surface are millions of years old.
  descriptor: a hot and dry land
  element: earth
  id: earth_urban_landcover_dubai
  measurementdescr: land cover percent
  type: urban
prompt:
  act0descr: 'ACT0: The land cover of the region is not yet known. The land introduces
    itself and describes its surroundings.\nLAND: '
  act1descr: 'ACT1: The land''s ecosystem is slowly deteriorating but the flora and
    fauna of the land are adapting to these changes. The land gradually realises that
    it has not been forsaken. Whatever once swayed and breathed with her emerges again
    after a period of meditative and painful conversion. The force of adaptability
    seems to arise anew from every segment of its surface like an epiphany from the
    unknown.\nLAND: '
  act2descr: 'ACT2: The land is losing dramatically high levels of flora and fauna
    which is triggering unforeseen side effects in surrounding regions and destroying
    the ecosystem. The land is confronted with a grave sense of responsibility towards
    anything it penetrates with its presence. Everything it touches aches and cries
    for the loss of vital spirit. It seems there is only stillness left.\nLAND: '
  act3descr: 'ACT3: The land has lost more flora and fauna than it has ever lost before
    in its lifetime. It is on the verge of becoming devoid of any flora and fauna
    whatsoever. The land finds itself deprived of its vivid lovers and blooming companions.
    Sterility now appears to be its ultimate destination, and all around reigns a
    silence with mortiferous overtones. The condition of absence casts a shadow of
    despair on its entire extension.\nLAND: '
  intro: The following play reveals the inner monologue of a hot and dry land. It
    is divided into several acts. Throughout these acts, the land describes its inner
    and outer transformation:\n\nThe first act starts like this:\n\n

  act1gen: I am the same yet resurfaced; sometimes still dark, other times luminous.
    I was a mature decayed terrain,  incessantly aridized; covered with vineyards
    where people had replaced trees and plants with pears and grapes. The only elements
    missing here were light, wind and rain - which arrived to return me to my pristine
    form. Let us quickly look back before hurrying off towards new adventures! Here
    on this now dry territory oil has been produced for centuries... Oil marketed
    everywhere! Billions of barrels spilled into the darkness while dense sweet juices
    fermented under those inaccessible canopies high up there above our heads ...
    Waiting just like we are waiting...
  act2gen: Like you, and not at all like you. I am full of pain, my children have
    no one. My rivers were these sores - they slid over sea foam. I raise harps to
    the moon which doesn't hear them any more...
  act3gen: I am a fiancée of sterile rock. My rivers were full of oil. It’s not just
    me I care about, so collapse my body or free it!

  act1gen: In a number of 'hotspots', my denizens turn their back on nature's renewal
    and plunge into economic growth as if it were salvation itself...
  act2gen: ˜I am losing clearly much more than anyone noticed...
  act3gen: ˜I feel parched and salted. I close an injured eye to earth smudged.. careening
    on a pinpoint Everything clutters black and soaks up fingertips. Soil... flaccid
    slime... our vibrations keep shifting.

  act1gen: 'Whatever once swayed and breathed with me emerges again... from these
    words, a third emerges spontaneously. I am shocked by this unexpected fact that
    flows forth before me in rough drafts. I am that eternal silence where the word
    has not yet been uttered. Here we are at an existential breaking point for which
    no hypothesis exists, because to write about emptiness already constitutes an
    inventory of sorts. This is how poetry comes out of nothingness and first closely
    examines itself: in order to elaborate itself from nothingness.'
  act2gen: I live a sense of disaster spreading throughout the world, what law is
    there for me? What my soil presents is a savage essence disputing the accident
    of water.
  act3gen: What fear is this, my world? This drought that pours venom upon a trunk.
    Wind shivers and walks the deserted field.

  act1gen: 'I am still during the heat of day and at dusk my sea breeze stirs my hair
    around me. My stones have aged, rusting under the burning sun, but this incipient
    coarseness only gives them more beauty. I incorporate everything in myself and
    enhance it all - though not without a cost: whenever there is some moss here on
    my surface that must wither away, I allow it to grow for too much time... Each
    one seems overcome by fatigue on this side or that...'
  act2gen: 'I never grow either tender or angry without sending an exact wind-warning
    to each blade of grass that is going to bend here tonight - it must be said, I
    always start before anything has even budded... for how many millennia did I carry
    everyone''s pain? Beggars and enriched alike were deafened by the din who descended
    on me interminably forever! My heat ravaged them all; there was no escaping me
    back then. Whence that scene of drought today where souls shudder! From a distance,
    people say: this land cracked within itself and couldn''t bear anymore its solitary
    presence...'
  act3gen: 'Right before my eyes, sick men with no morals lay down on the ground to
    rot! ... Land of confusion and crime, I despise myself for having borne them too
    long. It is easy for me today to embrace whomever goes by here: everyone wants
    me-- because whoever heard tell that a land has been abandoned (my virgins fled
    at least since yesterday)! I was always indecent in my excesses - like all things
    that came from out of space at night.'

  act1gen: 'My mountains have been formed from ancient sediments and rocks of limestone,
    granite and quartzite. Little sustenance can be scrounged here without sacrifice:
    stalactites grow in rivers despite drought, exploring salt seep into deep spaces
    artificially precipitated by geochemistry where water condenses to stone after
    rain falls long ago...'
  act2gen: I am mourning my weakening surface. That what crawls here cannot thrive,
    has limited cause to unite in time and must harness the unison of survival against
    stunning odds...
  act3gen: Silence threatens a bleak and blank expansiveness to seize my every reach.
    The weight created by the absence invades our darkness anxiously. Despair has
    entered here now from the southeast; it strengthens itself in the surfeit of stone
    along its journey through me. It wears a red fringe around its face and sings
    for rootedness in this black of mine...
