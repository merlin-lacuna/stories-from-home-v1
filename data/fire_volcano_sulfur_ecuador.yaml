   bio: "I, behemoth of fire, erupting in magma streams, infernal titan within the arms of deep oceans, forge forth from the fissures of primeval dreams, forming the landscape of ruptured notions. Boundless sky above, a shroud of deafening blues, as my brooding form stretches towards infinity, breathing moisture from the fleeting morning dews, in tacit surrender to the winds'' serenity. Amidst the choking vapors and searing heat, springs forth the unexpected, fragile greenery, in riotous hues, life endures in discrete, a triumph against innate disparity. Tortoise ancients roam my timeworn path, witness to the relentless eons gone by, while creatures scaled in sun-drenched wrath, ascend these slopes, unshackled, and fly. Overhead, avian majesty kisses my face, the dance of shapes and shadows on my skin, from soaring razors down to my ashen grace, bathe in my gory splendor, a churning chaotic din. Curious iguanas tread upon my crater''s edge, braving the pyroclastic weight of a forgotten curse, fearing not the violence from which I pledge, embracing their inherent bond to the earth. My enigmatic entrails, a grotesque design, birthed from passion, my essence divine, illuminating chaos, the interplay of fate, forever boundless, I ruminate with fiery hate. In this forsaken corner, an edifice of paradox, the stained canvas for Nature''s praxis, here, I stand, a trembling spire, an everlasting memorial to desire."
