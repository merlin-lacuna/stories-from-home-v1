   bio: "In mine own realm of ash and embers, i stand before eternity, a silent sentinel of stone, and watch the sun traverse its sphere.\nEver transforming, yet unchanging, winds billow round my walls of blackened glass, and till the patient rocks to soil, shape me new garments, green and wild.\nSnowmelt weeps from glistening crags, and in its rivulets, whispers currents sustained, invisible, like the bated breath of night that slips away\nRetreating from the dawn it cradles in its dark embrace.\nCreatures dwell upon my breast and hide within my alcoves;\nBound by instinct, tempered with patience, veined wings spread upon thermals whims, to the horizon stretched, as vast and boundless as the infinite.\nBehold the seasons form a tapestry of shifting colors.\nHonor to the vibrant greens, eternal homage to the golds and bronzes, and silent prayers for the long, white pall.\nI am more than hardened lava born in fiery tumult, more than dust and ice from ancient times.\nThe spirit of the land runs deep within me, transcending matter, energy, and flight.\nFor I have held the splendid gaze of Luna, and felt Apollo's tender touch, have wept for Gaia as she turns and turns again, the unyielding echoes of my solitude resound within my hidden caverns.\nYet my history is writ not in ink but through the ponderous elements, gathered in the heart of earth and shaped by heaven's hand, my memories worn like wedded rings of gold, and passed from age to age by the breath of wind and woe."

prompt:
   intro: 'The following play reveals the inner monologue of a volcanic, subarctic region of land. It is divided into several acts. Throughout these acts, the land describes its inner and outer transformation:\n\nThe first act starts like this:\n\n'
   act0descr: "ACT0: The land''s air temperature is not yet known. The land introduces itself and describes its surroundings.\nLAND:"
   act1descr: 'ACT1: The land''s air is warmer than it usually is and its ecosystem is beginning to struggle. All the granules of sand seem to vanish, and the land is now confronted with a hopeless state of inability to react. It no more has full control of the constituents that used to form its body and spirit. All crumbles and pales under a merciless sun.\nLAND:'
   act2descr: 'ACT2: The land is experiencing a completely normal year with a normal air temperature. It hosts organisms that typically thrive in the land. The land experiences the encounter with an nearly alien element, or at least detects its influence. The aura of tundra permeates its surface and the wind gives a glimpse of new horizons, altering its inner landscape.\nLAND:'
   act3descr: 'ACT3: The land''s air is extremely cold and there is barely any nutrition for organisms to survive. The freeze of the land is no longer its vital condition, as it no more seems to originate from its very essence, but rather due to unknown and destructive external forces impossible to placate.\nLAND:'
