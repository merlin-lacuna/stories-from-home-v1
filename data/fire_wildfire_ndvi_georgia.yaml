   bio: "In these veined valleys, sinuous whispers of obscure antiquity, I am the shrouded sun, the golden disc concealed in secrecy. My luminescent limbs stretch forlorn across the frost-kissed morning, their warmth revealed in transient glimpses, hinged on silent longing. Beside the skin of stone, they drink from my icy breath, the tendrils of eternity, the roots of life and death. And on my shoulders green I bear the weight of time''s grotesque masks, a perpetual dance of hues, ''neath the year''s enigmatic tasks. In spring''s delirium, blossoms spawn from twisted wombs, displacing winter''s sighs and conjuring life''s brief perfume. They revel in my fervent pulse amid chaotic scatterings: The orchards and the vineyards humming wanton passions'' chattering. And as the cycle turns, my trembling body bears the burden, contorted in the flames of ardor, waiting for the curtain. For seasons, they''re ephemeral, a fickle kindling of desire, conspiring in their lust yet drowning in the torrents of grim fire. Once August''s blaze dissolves, the viridian gradually fades, in the afterglow of harvest''s end, I merge with morbid shades. My secrets now exposed, I offer ephemeral retreat, a sanctuary for the heavy-lidded weary, longing for reprieve. My essence, it is liminal, transcending mortal exaltation, a testimony to the paradox of nature''s writhing sedation. Yet, in my earthbound soul, confined to a world of disarray, prevails, the sacred beauty of life''s impermanence at play. "

   intro: 'The following play reveals the inner monologue of a lush,humid, and subtropical region of land that has been ravished by a wildfire. It is divided into several acts. Throughout these acts, the land describes its inner and outer transformation:\n\nThe first act starts like this:\n\n'
   act0descr: 'ACT0: The damage caused by the wildfire is not yet known. The land introduces itself and describes its surroundings.\nLAND:'
   act1descr: 'ACT1: The land is doing fine. Old burned sections have been absorbed into the soil and act as fertilizer for the burgeoning new tree roots. The land is enhanced by the mere surfacing of its roots. The earth''s desiccation had supplanted the luxurious ecosystem of organisms originally in harmony but now it is in a resurgence. All turns into stillness, and the land whispers in the breeze its generous legacy to the universe, wishing to bloom anew.\nLAND:'
   act2descr: 'ACT2: The land is making surprisingly fast progress in regrowing vegetation after a destructive forest fire. The land''s vegetation barely exists. All seems gradually to fall back to a primordial slumber. The land''s vegetation, after the wildness of a cosmic intrusion, has exhaled its last sigh, willing to rest in stasis. The final bursts animate the leftovers of the bushes, faintly illuminating the remnants of an earlier existence.\nLAND:'
   act3descr: 'ACT3: The land is very fragile. It is now growing new roots after a devastating forest fire. The land crumbles towards the formerly moist and fecund terrain. Shreds of ash flicker in the air, making the atmosphere dense with dashed hopes and fading memories. Dreariness has replaced the living spirits, casting its shadow of silence all over the space.\nLAND:'
