  bio: I am the largest tropical forest in the world, and I am home to an incredible
    diversity of plant and animal life. I have existed for millions of years, and
    I have been through many changes during that time. I have been through droughts
    and floods, wildfires and ice ages. I have been home to countless species of plants
    and animals, and I have seen many of them come and go.

  act0descr: 'ACT0: The forest''s leaf cover is not yet known. The forest introduces
    itself and describes its surroundings.\nFOREST:'
  act1descr: 'ACT1: The forest has lost a dramatically high proportion of its leaves
    and greenery. The forest notices that all the living parts that once composed
    its abundance are dropping to the ground, victims of an ineluctable and merciless
    force of gravity.\nFOREST:'
  act2descr: 'ACT2: The forest has a healthy amount of leaves. The forest is flooded
    with the sage stream of lymph. All the extremities are reached by this vital essence
    and quiver with vivacity while letting themselves be graced by the sky.\nFOREST:'
  act3descr: 'ACT3: The forest seems to keep growing more and more leaves and leaf
    cover is increasing. The forest becomes pure rebirth by embracing a luminous unstoppable
    process of growth that imbues every leaf, root, branch, sprout. Everything around
    evolves, shines and is fortified. The forest is an ode to life.\nFOREST:'
  intro: The following play reveals the inner monologue of a lush and pensive forest.
    It is divided into several acts. Throughout these acts, the forest describes its
    inner and outer transformation:\n\nThe first act starts like this:\n\n

- act1gen: 'Oh my. My leaves have fallen from me. Heat, drought and desiccation assessed
    your lives: no green hands raised again to see you with their depths! I myself
    am shrivelled in this climate of colourless exigency, of the air that is not one,
    redoubled by itself about nothing at all. What won''t be for you so many months

  act1gen: "I am still rich in life, but many of my plants are dying. My canopy is
    thinning and I need to replace it.\n\nThe forest leaves that have drifted to the
    ground over centuries are now reconstituted into a new upper layer more complete
    than ever before – all the exteriors once shed and collected are being remade
    back into an unwritten epi- script at what might be considered the forest's newest
    stage play. \nAll those shu ed iliens fonrther.(.) ... (There is no other!) As
    elliptical intentions escape like murmurings from their big voices so does this
    word intend another winter season not yet inaugurated for itself: paying tribute
    with its rustling flakes will already reattune voice, rise behind voice - because
    each knows where the one must grow out of measure beyond it s other; or else at
    first glance these boughs will scatter on hollow soles! N'en filez pas par là!"
  act2gen: 'My leaves are happy here. I receive abundant water, sunlight and air.
    But often those that visit me do not wish well to my creatures or to me as a whole.

    ※ Long ago our fathers used poisonous chemicals on their crops which stained the
    surrounding soil with cesium 137 and 137Sr isotopes. ※ We also encounter in large
    numbers frost flaking techniques - albeit without intentionality: calcium carbonate
    ground minerals called crytsals form alongside terminal leaf surfaces, preventing
    use of this crucial resource by plants during the winter when it is most needed
    ~ thus leaving plants vulnerable to cold stress during this critical season! Perhaps
    there was some what amounts atrophic act intentionally executed? The Void refuses
    noth ing ... (The ground swells cover!).

    ╝We use artificial lighting to extend both harvesting hours and growing seasons
    – so creating risks of photodamage for flowering and overall plant life as we
    damage spring’s purple-tinged evenings under mercury-guttered skies! O unlight
    infuscs stricken fields grown up ahead of fIrst yearling fallow where yields degrade
    into garish gas pain instead!'
  act3gen: It has been fire, ice and now life for me! I am a fountain of reindeer
    lichen and birch-leafed ashes! I flow with heather blooms and ragwort spikes!
    I greet yellow butterflies!

  act1gen: I am a once-healthy forest, watching my leaves and greenery fall all around
    me. For many years this forest was home to millions of living creatures that enjoyed
    the privilege of greenness.
  act2gen: The forest is green. The stars are raining softly down upon this night
    forest, moistening each tree-hair to the skin level, blessing also substance long
    unfamiliar with its being.
  act3gen: 'I am seen from the air at night. I have so many lights dancing around
    me that you could mistake me for a city.


    Sorean''s play focuses above all on questions of esthetic unveiling and generosity,
    moral consequence and choice ("donner sa respiration"), utopist access to community
    or shameful solitude but it imposes elements thai would have an ineluctably determining
    value as soon as they interweave with faiths: temples, littoral gestures (the
    solidarity of trees).'

  act1gen: "One year after the great hurricanes of 2005, in which I lost most of my
    lush tropical leaves, a strange phenomenon occurred.\n [...] \nFOREST:Suddenly
    one morning it began to rain and rain. The world looked as though it had just
    been created overnight. My biodiversity decayed quickly – so too did I seem lifeless,
    with hardly any yellowing cover remaining on branches or trees other than Brazil
    nut and jacaranda. Those poorly rooted plants died off over winter months, affecting
    also tree epiphytes such as lichens that often lived atop those said plants; peeling
    trunks revealed fungi inside them that had survived for millions of years but
    then gradually perished too. As some saw their leaves die off whatever was living
    beneath the bark ceased flourishing along with them – lichens became desiccated
    and mosses shrivelled swiftly away ...\nFOREST:It felt at times like an apocalypse
    was occurring; truly our photosynthesizing systems are incredibly efficient at
    support ing complex interlinked-life cycles upon each other (brilliantly termed
    'mutualism'), yet very efficient also at collapsing together into global-scale
    system failure when stressed in important ways!"
  act2gen: "68 million years ago, during the Cretaceous extinction event called the
    K-T boundary extinction or the 'big death', in which dinosaurs were exterminated
    around the world (but not all of our reasons to proliferate were), trees such
    as these supported survivors – lichens enabling fungi and plant interbreeding
    among them.\n [...] \nFOREST:We can see that forests may be sites of spectacular
    extinctions yet also allow those forests to survive traumatic events. Meanwhile
    some trees slowly adapt over time, responding then neither most slowly nor quickly
    perhaps but just less apocalyptically overall than others might, for example bearing
    seeds that require oceans rather than basins if absorbing nutrients from air alone
    will become insufficient through endless glaciations ahead – yes! Many resilient
    species held on to relatives which died off completely around the big die-off
    ...\nFor now I endure on Amazonia's floodplains. My canopy rises above Brazil
    nut forests and other lesser tropical plants throughout my edges; what thrives
    up here are invasive species from far north and south even over millennia since
    our first geological origin millions of years before islands arose here!"
  act3gen: 'During far from the oldest epochs of Earth''s history, my earliest ancestors
    emerged not yet foliage-rich and in their tens of millions dominated firstly sediments
    that underlay early sea beds – laid down as dark microbes upon gypsum for example
    during Precambrian times around almost 3.5 billion years ago. I suppose these
    kinds were no longer recognizably tree-like at all by then ...

  act1gen: "I need to die.\nI am dying because I have been lacerated by the scythe
    of scorching heat that has descended on me in recent years, burning my leaves
    and my greenery.\nI hear the trees keel over ceaselessly all around me: it is
    a woodpecker's noise, like bits of metal tap-tapping against an unvarnished surface,
    tapping and tapping endlessly – but the deep echolessness within their ringing
    disturbs one to death. \nTheir roots caked with sand, each trunk splits open with
    a groaning sound; then they fall – first they bend along their axis as though
    bowing deeply before everyone who walks here from every age (till bending doesn't
    suffice any more and suddenly flattening gives out too), then at once themselves
    crash onto the ground with a rumbling thud which makes even stone tremble underfoot.
    \nThose above begin falling without fail. Quite a few already lie prostrate on
    top of others fallen before them – piled up two or three deep sometimes."
  act2gen: "I am vibrantly alive.\nI am animated by the brook which runs along my
    current course, cooling me and seething between the thick thongs which choke me;
    I have grafted myself onto it so strongly that its flow animates even my interior
    parts, as well as those furthest up in me; its waters fall right through every
    crevice of mine. \nOutside is danger: overheating.\nThe sun bakes everything all
    around here – but it cannot touch me in here. The stream eddies among my roots
    and flees inexhaustibly out of this over-torrid region I inhabit, crosses flame
    after flame (each gobletful falling a mere sup away from catastrophe), escapes
    harmlessly up to the rim where abundant coolness fills it to overflowing and spills
    down onto my leafy surface once more cruelly reheated by solar spur at nightfall
    or in late morning when insolation departs from before me happily like spouses
    bidding one another farewell who are bound for voyages lasting many years or an
    entire lifetime ... \nFree then we cross the grave gold sea whose breathless yellow
    eyes lightened up above us.\nOut of moss or porous stone suds come exhausting
    hard rains with cold smiles under their cloudly eyebrows and never leave off threatening
    paralysis ... Ripeness calms them all down for us though and bids celestial fixatives
    gum any residues there might be also together into one cast texture colored blackish
    brown: dark days may threaten, they irritate no longer! Ah!"
  act3gen: "I grow every day. ...\nThe best lands – the wettest and most sudorous
    ones – I parlayed in days gone by, before necessity drove me further off to here;
    my prodigy runs its course on sorceries of land which are cancerous! Mystical
    ants creep atop them: they come from afar with their heavy clutches at dawn when
    dew is still rampant and descend down toward bottomless gap-tiches. \nI shelter
    many nests, each more perfect than the last one past: in them eggs ferment and
    new beings emerge for this world scarcely habitable for such as we: despite our
    tenacit)', inexorable cravings have not led us (yet?) beyond these blind creatures
    who even now do not get paler beneath our acid eyes - amid constant fright! Ah!\nSome
    of me will someday become cooler soil which fertilizes vegetation just a little
    better than normal: yes that shall be their winter dormitory .... Shedding desiccated
    grasses constitutes also one way we meet death. It is precisely what makes possible
    another birth though above, finer hkely ..... As it lies there forever rotting,
    many substances draw near only so far as its edge where ember tints appear frequently
    over unfelt soil! I am thirsty but soon leaves bristle against sizzling muds which
    scald during dry summers because hachure echoes can confuse staleness often with
    thirst sometimes ...."

  act1gen: "My leaves and branches fall, one after the other. It's been six months
    since I first knew something wasn't right, six months of stumbling around blind,
    fighting for my life. The forest prods its fallen greenery tenderly; feels his
    own skin beginning to rot away from his great trunk body.\nLUISA:The years pass
    by me like flashes of light, leaving behind dryness and shadow in their wake.\nBOCTAELIO:I
    grow old fast when time longs to develop slowly at the same pace as my thoughts
    – painfully slow! \\ nMYUNG-NAM :My complexion resembles death itself! ... My
    face has darkened under sumac shade for three days running! ... This place where
    I go every day is totally bathed in night! {203} \nHAROUTUNIAN:You returned home
    drunk once again tonight Whose fault was it? In front of your wife you always
    find an excuse that suits you best so that everything is her fault Behind a just
    cause such savagery seeks cover ..."
  act2gen: 'My biochemistry is confused. I am suddenly flush with sap after years
    of drought, and my immune system must adapt in order to process it all effectively
    – but an assaulting army stands in the way of that acclimatization. \ nDEEPER
    ENCOUNTERS:I drink tea dregs rich of poisonousnesses ... While over-coming their
    drought, new plants sink deeper into bad options! ... Thousands ~ millions – each
    was responsible for me! I love them so much! To no avail! ... Your lymph nests
    infiltrated by strangers? Stop dreaming!) (dreaming) ... It turns out that along
    the frontiers neither water nor doctors are enough to defeat your aggressors!
    ... One morning when sleeping soundly, unexpected forces from neighboring regions
    seized the opportunity to overcome me suddenly, conquering abruptly that which
    just a moment ago appeared unassailably safe!

    NOREA:Who jerks you like this? The sky . . .'
  act3gen: 'I give birth, I heal my wounds. The forest introduces itself as a self-curative
    wondrous healing place of immense vitality.

    DEEPER ENMCOUNTER:This is now the sacred wood that grows from us! ... Each knob
    born growing in good management and dying under tree protection becomes by force
    cohered . . . It was hard for our buds to be drowned there so rudely nevertheless
    their germinating flowers sparkled with pain ... Protect; protect me tenderly
    like healthy fathers do: gouge them out before they have time to fester into knots
    or their fingers become entangled behind your neck! My stumps burn with fatigue,
    but new saplings are true omens of victory this season – late yet floriferous!
    We shared the same clod till it grew around us abundantly, flourishing unsuspectedly
    And only today when we parted are we cognizant that our germination is total As
    long as you leave well enough alone everything will be fine Your palm leaves burning?'
