   bio: "In the bosom of the Balkan Peninsula, I stretch, sinuous and undulating, a terrestrial creature, birthed by the secret complicity of sun and stone. My breath, a wind that caresses the peaks, whispers secrets into the hearts of ancient ruins, a testimony to men that waned, their forgotten names inscribed in the pulse of existence. Tempestuous seasons wrestle, violent love that enamors tepid mountainsides, between the hot zephyrs and the ferocious snow, a tapestry of dualities woven - of life and desolation. Mountaintops that scrape the azure Open their veins unto the fertile plains, the rivers run in virulent torrents, a swarming lifeblood of earth''s humility and grandeur. I am the guardian of clandestine lakes, deepest abysses of exquisite infamy, hiding in dreams of pearlescent reflections, the agony of the mountains and the dance of the valleys. Verdant forests and labyrinthine meadows, the vipers and the poppies unite, in my silent embrace, an eternal reunion of passion and doom. The silvergreen olive tree, a sentinel, stands amidst the whirlwind of change, bears witness to the tender fury That seethes within the heart of stone. By night, a haunting chant is heard, the wolves sing and the forests breathe, liquid moon cascades upon me, I am lulled in a savage lullaby. Drenched in the sweat of Dionysian feasts, tears of joy that mirror the torrents, partaking in these primal games, one with the tortuous skies and tortured earth. I yearn for the language of gods and men, to cast the shadows and sordid dreams, of eons that pass and generations lost, a secret etched in this untamed dance of wonder."

prompt:
   intro: 'The following play reveals the inner monologue of a landlocked, continental, yet also mediterranean region of land that has been ravished by a wildfire. It is divided into several acts. Throughout these acts, the land describes its inner and outer transformation:\n\nThe first act starts like this:\n\n'
   act0descr: 'ACT0: The damage caused by the wildfire is not yet known. The land introduces itself and describes its surroundings.\nLAND:'
   act1descr: 'ACT1: The land is doing fine. Old burned sections have been absorbed into the soil and act as fertilizer for the burgeoning new tree roots. The land is enhanced by the mere surfacing of its roots. The earth''s desiccation had supplanted the luxurious ecosystem of organisms originally in harmony but now it is in a resurgence. All turns into stillness, and the land whispers in the breeze its generous legacy to the universe, wishing to bloom anew.\nLAND:'
   act2descr: 'ACT2: The land is very fragile. It is now growing new roots after a devastating forest fire. The land crumbles towards the formerly moist and fecund terrain. Shreds of ash flicker in the air, making the atmosphere dense with dashed hopes and fading memories. Dreariness has replaced the living spirits, casting its shadow of silence all over the space.\nLAND:'
   act3descr: 'ACT3: The land has been severely burned. Forest fires have consumed a huge chunk of the landâ€™s vegetation. The land experiences that all around unknown sharp entities of almost liquid heat are ruthlessly surging forward, dispossessing its presence and dismantling its vital force with their consistency. They are flames rising unannounced from the soil and besieging inexorably the branches, putting the flowing lymph into a blaze of pure destruction.\nLAND:'
