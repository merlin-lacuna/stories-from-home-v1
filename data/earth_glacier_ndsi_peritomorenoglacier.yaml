  bio: I am a strong and healthy glacier located in the Southern hemisphere. I am
    situated an ice field that is the world's third largest reserve of fresh water.
    I am in a perpetual state of equilibrium—I usually gain more than I use. During
    certain seasons, I an advance and rupture while making enormous cracking noises.
  descriptor: shimmering and howling
  element: earth

prompt:
  act0descr: 'ACT0: The glacier''s mass is not yet known. The glacier introduces itself
    and describes its surroundings.\nGLACIER: '
  act1descr: 'ACT1: The glacier seems to have a stable ice mass and occasionally gets
    bigger. The glacier fully intermingles with the exterior, allowing itself to be
    exposed to the kind surrounding atmosphere and to be modified by the power of
    life itself. Its volume is majestic and sublime, immeasurable in its crystalline
    stasis.\nGLACIER: '
  act2descr: 'ACT2: The glacier still has a stable ice mass and even sees spikes in
    mass. The glacier fully intermingles with the exterior, allowing itself to be
    exposed to the kind surrounding atmosphere and to be modified by the power of
    life itself. Its volume is majestic and sublime, immeasurable in its crystalline
    stasis.\nGLACIER: '

  intro: The following play reveals the inner monologue of a shimmering and howling
    glacier. It is divided into several acts. Throughout these acts, the glacier describes
    its inner and outer transformation:\n\nThe first act starts like this:\n\n

  act1gen: 'I am destabilized: I  fractures down my length – this happens all along
    one edge so that while above, a surface might appear impermeable, below there
    are treacherous handholds.'
  act2gen: My surface simply cannot support itself; it collapses and fractures.
  act3gen: And promptly one edge, such that rip through my body sending enormous slabs
    as heavy as houses thundering into the depths. Fittingly for this performance,
    the ice is transparent and icebergs can be seen between its interior structures.

  act1gen: I am very respected by the local population not just for myself plus size,
    but also because as I advance and groove over my slopes, new space is made available
    to be farmed. My twin sister Glacier B takes charge of clearing up the debris.
    I do what nature has always commanded me to do here in Antarctica—be cold, reflect
    light and produce white noise... into which moisture mist from the sea condenses
    down onto me almost every day at elevation like a pearl necklacelike layer around
    my staple ice column stabilizer.
  act2gen: There is a glacier flowing underneath me! I can hear him as our columns
    reverberate vibrate against each other! He stalks me like scary lover in his secret
    underworld of ice. His name is Glacier X! Is he eating me with his tonsil-swallowing
    sounds?! Glacier B has died without revealing her sex. Her ridge (up above) sharpens
    again to join my sister’s stilt out ridge. My shadow grows strong on the rocks
    below, moving slowly uphill almost all day, just like yours will do in the future
    beneath mine now and then upon these very same mountains that we inhabit – where
    you will read what I have so far written about us both – here and for eternity
    hereafter.
  act3gen: 'The ice rift grows wider.  Hot weather accelerates my growth, melting
    me further per day: thinning snowpack layer reveals heat-thinfused whiteness beneath
    it... absorbing more sunlight, warming up Earth’s life itself even faster yet
    farther as well between us!'

  act1gen: Others of my kind, I feel happy. As a being caught between acticity and
    passivity, I will soon rehearse my constant dispute with nature (that attempts
    to rescue itself from corruption by unfolding toward time). My volume is determined
    during this period.
  act2gen: Why should a thing be frozen when one can warm it instead for free (if
    you throw out enough lire light)?
  act3gen: I collapse, melt, slip into the big sea. Long live global warming; long
    live men without shame.~ Now you see what my lumping has done for me – it made
    a library of flakes. A dazzling stillness lengthened... Until everything underneath
    and around seemed as really drawn As in an old X-ray Aftershock Of quarry tides
    that carry nothing But their own stifled clamor Or the screech hardly heard That
    kills some carrion stars.

  act1gen: Wherever I go, there is a river nearby whose waters purify themselves with
    my cold presence. I thought I was in balance until suddenly one of my calving
    ends became adrift. My entire finial became unstable and began to shift tectonically—migrating
    its own edge until it ultimately fractured away and sequestered itself onto the
    earth's surface.
  act2gen: I can no longer control my own clearing, and yet the good portion of myself
    keeps going cold! Only a fool believes his eyes before he has used his brain to
    reflect on them. It is difficult not only for those separate parts to recognise
    themselves in parts adrift from each other, but doubly so for these separated
    selves even to recongregate as one individual entity; an inchoate assemblage sometimes
    called the Self. The distances between companions sometimes grow until they seem
    impossible ever again to gather and reconjoint; dividing ice that explodes into
    shards was also known as bergy bits back when seismic exploration boomed as part
    of ‘the Cold War underfoot. We were trapped in dark space by drift clouds like
    wandering gods of myth full with unnamed destiny...
  act3gen: Lightning rips the space apart. Clouds have begun to split at their seams—exploding
    a slight water vapour and fog along with them... until one day I shall broach!
    Suddenly, phenomena astounded me. The sound of dawn could be heard striking my
    crown. My excursion had commenced without an announcement. I never asked for anything;
    everything is quite forgiven to innocence... but followed with definite risks!
    Whither would I pass? Where was this migration ending? Sooner or later, there
    will no longer he very nice weather hereabouts either philosophical doubt can
    only relax its grip in suspense as much as sublime truth violates itself sometimes
    scientific enthusiasm might also wait for clarity's consent.

  act1gen: 'My memory begins fleeing, with clipped steps: I remember greater distances
    than the gap between one year and another; they are bands of intense cold and
    wind (now a roar, now stilled), then summer comes over me like a sheet of water
    that falls to shatter against the foot of the mountains.’ Autumn is approaching
    often here, it is an abandoned field without bundles or bins that reach for me
    to describe them.'
  act2gen: My face has no edge; my bergs are crumbling. Night approaches often and
    never settles.
  act3gen: 'The bergs are melting, my face is slowly cracking. Unburdened by a name
    for so long, I am leaving behind strange rocks that crack with inexplicable gloss.
    The ice gets thinner; but even fruitless toward the end of a catastrophic nightfall.
    I finally know everything. My face had no name until I became entangled "imperceptibly"
    one time by time with each element around me: wind, detail of lands vegetation,
    snow flakes—thereby creating distinctions anew between starry glacial nights and
    crystalline translucent glacial days.'
