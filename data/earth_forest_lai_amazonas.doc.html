Each knob born growing in good management and dying under tree protection becomes by force cohered . . . It was hard for our buds to be drowned there so rudely nevertheless their germinating flowers sparkled with pain ... Protect; protect me tenderly like healthy fathers do: gouge them out before they have time to fester into knots or their fingers become entangled behind your neck! My stumps burn with fatigue, but new saplings are true omens of victory this season – late yet floriferous! We shared the same clod till it grew around us abundantly, flourishing unsuspectedly And only today when we parted are we cognizant that our germination is total As long as you leave well enough alone everything will be fine Your palm leaves burning?</td>

My cones wilt in their capsules space-time has left them behind. I see the well-laid scheme you&#x27;re weaving; – such chaos:  dead bodies steal release from bare skeleton branches,  burn off into air like phantom ships consumed by strange chemicals. These fires come during lightning strikes Lightning blinks through a webbed camouflage making me nearly invisible. wildest weathers shedding sodden green leaf catacomb.</td>
