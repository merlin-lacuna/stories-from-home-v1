    bio: "I am a murmur entwined in the rainforest, sheathed in ceaseless torrents I am cast. Weathered by the impetuous dance of air, the lush carpet exhales a cradle of life. Carousing between opaque clouds of mystery, i harbor torrents of secrets beneath a verdant canvas. Neither saint nor a demon, I dwell in passion''s purgatory, here exists my purpose, not to destroy but to create. Flourishing life within my veins of rivers, i course in pulsing streams of copious abundance. In the darkest corners of my embrace, souls of the shadows unfurl and bloom. Beings I harbor in aromatic skins, proclaim their presence in the twilight hour. Quiet whispers echo through the trees, uttering secrets veiled beneath the fog. Chaotic order entwines in the marriage of grass and foliage, in harmony, they dance and flourish with undying grace. Strangers intrude, seeking redemption in my being, i am a mirror of their hearts, reflections I reveal. Bound to the cycle of life and decay, a symphony of birth and collapse resounds. My existence, transient tethered to a transient world, i am the essence of the eternal transience that upholds. I do not feel the weight of the tangled arms I carry, the burden of stolen breaths a mere absence of a presence. No resilience is needed when growth embraces the fragile, peek through the labyrinth and witness the majesty of the everyday. Within me, a confluence of elements awakens, an unmatched symphony of life''s splendor unravels. I am the fire seduced by the water, the wind mingling with the earth in a venerated union. I am the keeper of an unwritten book, an epic tale concealed within my soul. A thousand stories but none that may be shared, for here lies the sacred confessions belonging to a beloved sanctuary."
